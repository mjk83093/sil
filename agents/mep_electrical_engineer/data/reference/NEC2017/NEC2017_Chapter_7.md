Transformer secondary conductors other than 2-wire shall not be considered to be protected by the primary overcurrent protection.
VA max is the maximum volt-ampere output after one minute of operation regardless of load and with overcurrent protection bypassed,  if  used.  Current-limiting  impedance  shall  not  be bypassed when determining VA max . (E)  Input  Side  of  Electronic  Power  Source.

FIGURE  725.154(A) Cable Substitution Hierarchy.
Informational Note: One method of defining fire-resistant characteristics capable of preventing the carrying of fire from floor to  floor  is  that  the  cables  pass  the  requirements  of  ANSI/ UL  1666-2012, Test  for  Flame  Propagation  Height  of  Electrical  and Optical-Fiber Cable Installed Vertically in Shafts.
- (C)  Types CL2 and CL3. Types CL2 and CL3 cables shall be marked as Type CL2 or CL3, respectively, and be listed as suitable for general-purpose use, with the exception of risers, ducts, plenums, and other space used for environmental air, and shall be listed as resistant to the spread of fire.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  defining resistant  to  the spread of fire is that the cables do not spread fire to the top of the tray in the UL flame exposure, vertical tray flame test in ANSI/ UL 1685-2010, Standard for Safety for  Vertical-Tray  Fire-Propagation and  Smoke-Release  Test  for  Electrical  and  Optical-Fiber  Cables .  The smoke measurements in the test method are not applicable.
Another method of defining resistant to the spread of fire is for the damage (char length) not to exceed 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in.) when performing  the  CSA  vertical  flame  test  for-  cables  in  cable trays, as described in CSA C22.2 No. 0.3-M-2001, Test Methods for Electrical Wires and Cables .
## ARTICLE 725 - CLASS 1, CLASS 2, &amp; CLASS 3 REMOTE-CONTROL, SIGNALING, &amp; POWER-LIMITED CIRCUITS 725.179
#### (D)  Types CL2X and CL3X. Types CL2X and CL3X limiteduse  cables  shall  be  marked  as  Type  CL2X  or  CL3X,  and  be listed as suitable for use in dwellings and raceways and shall be listed as resistant to flame spread.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  determining  that  cable  is resistant  to  flame  spread  is  by  testing  the  cable  to  the  VW-1 (vertical wire) flame test in ANSI/UL 1581-2011, Reference Standard for Electrical Wires, Cables and Flexible Cords .
#### (E)  Type  PLTC. Type  PLTC  nonmetallic-sheathed,  powerlimited tray cable shall be listed as being suitable for cable trays and shall consist of a factory assembly of two or more insulated conductors under a nonmetallic jacket. The insulated conductors shall be 22 AWG through 12 AWG. The conductor material shall  be  copper (solid or stranded). Insulation on conductors shall be rated for 300 volts. The cable core shall be two or more parallel  conductors,  one  or  more  group  assemblies  of  twisted or  parallel  conductors,  or  a  combination  thereof.  A  metallic shield  or  a  metallized  foil  shield  with  drain  wire(s)  shall  be permitted  to  be  applied  over  the  cable  core,  over  groups  of conductors, or both. The cable shall be listed as resistant to the spread  of  fire.  The  outer  jacket  shall  be  a  sunlight-  and moisture-resistant nonmetallic material. Type PLTC cable used in a wet location shall be listed for use in wet locations or have a moisture-impervious metal sheath.
Exception No. 1: Where a smooth metallic sheath, continuous corrugated  metallic  sheath,  or  interlocking  tape  armor  is  applied  over  the nonmetallic jacket, an overall nonmetallic jacket shall not be required. On metallic-sheathed  cable  without  an  overall  nonmetallic  jacket,  the information  required  in  310.120  shall  be  located  on  the  nonmetallic jacket under the sheath.

The substitutions for optical fiber cables in Table 770.154(b) and illustrated in Figure 770.154 shall be permitted. Another method of defining resistant to the spread of fire is for the damage (char length) not to exceed 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in.) when performing the CSA vertical flame test - cables in cable trays, as described in CSA C22.2 No. 0.3-M-2001, Test Methods for Electrical Wires and Cables .
## Part VI. Listing Requirements
### 770.179  Optical  Fiber  Cables. Optical  fiber  cables  shall  be listed  and  identified  in  accordance  with  770.179(A)  through (F)  and  shall  be  marked  in  accordance  with  Table  770.179. Optical fiber cables shall have a temperature rating of not less than 60°C (140°F). Temperature rating shall be marked on the jacket  of  optical  fiber  cables  that  have  a  temperature  rating exceeding 60°C (140°F).
#### (A)  Types OFNP and OFCP. Types OFNP and OFCP nonconductive  and  conductive  optical  fiber  plenum  cables  shall  be suitable  for  use  in  ducts,  plenums,  and  other  space  used  for environmental  air  and  shall  also  have  adequate  fire-resistant and low smoke producing characteristics.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  defining  a  cable  that  has adequate fire-resistant and low-smoke producing characteristics is that the cable exhibits a maximum peak optical density of 0.50 or  less,  an  average  optical  density  of  0.15  or  less,  and  a  maximum flame spread distance of 1.52 m (5 ft) or less when tested in  accordance  with  NFPA  262 -2015, Standard  Method  of  Test  for Flame Travel and Smoke of Wires and Cables for Use in Air-Handling Spaces .
#### (B)  Types  OFNR  and  OFCR. Types  OFNR  and  OFCR nonconductive  and  conductive  optical  fiber  riser  cables  shall be suitable for use in a vertical run in a shaft or from floor to floor and shall also have the fire-resistant characteristics capable of preventing the carrying of fire from floor to floor.
Informational Note: One method of defining fire-resistant characteristics capable of preventing the carrying of fire from floor to  floor  is  that  the  cables  pass  the  requirements  of  ANSI/ UL 1666-2011, Standard Test for Flame Propagation Height of Electrical and Optical-Fiber Cable Installed Vertically in Shafts .
#### (C)  Types  OFNG  and  OFCG. Types  OFNG  and  OFCG nonconductive  and  conductive  general-purpose  optical  fiber cables shall be suitable for general-purpose use, with the exception  of  risers  and  plenums,  and  shall  also  be  resistant  to  the spread of fire.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  defining resistant  to  the spread of fire is for the damage (char length) not to exceed 1.5 m (4  ft  11  in.)  when  performing  the  CSA  vertical  flame  test  cables in cable trays, as described in CSA C22.2 No. 0.3-M-2001, Test Methods for Electrical Wires and Cables .
#### (D)  Types OFN and OFC. Types OFN and OFC nonconductive  and  conductive  optical  fiber  cables  shall  be  suitable  for general-purpose use, with the exception of risers, plenums, and other spaces used for environmental air, and shall also be resistant to the spread of fire.
Informational Note No. 1: One method of defining resistant  to the spread of fire is that the cables do not spread fire to the top of the  tray  in  the  UL  flame  exposure,  vertical  tray  flame  test  in ANSI/UL  1685-2010, Standard  for  Safety for Vertical-Tray FirePropagation  and  Smoke-Release  Test  for  Electrical  and  Optical-Fiber Cables .  The  smoke  measurements  in  the  test  method  are  not applicable.
Informational Note No. 2: Cable types are listed in descending order of fire resistance rating. Within each fire resistance rating, nonconductive cable is listed first because it is often substituted for conductive cable.
#### (E)  Circuit Integrity (CI) Cable or Electrical Circuit Protective System. Cables that are used for survivability of critical circuits under  fire  conditions  shall  meet  either  770.179(E)(1)  or (E)(2).
Informational Note: The listing organization provides information for circuit integrity (CI) cable and electrical circuit protective  systems,  including  installation  requirements  necessary  to maintain the fire rating.
(1)  Circuit Integrity (CI) Cables. Circuit integrity (CI) cables specified in 770.179(A) through (D), and used for survivability of critical circuits, shall have an additional classification using the suffix 'CI.' In order to maintain its listed fire rating, circuit integrity (CI) cable shall only be installed in free air.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  defining  circuit  integrity (CI)  cable  is  by  establishing  a  minimum  2-hour  fire  resistance rating  for  the  cable  when  tested  in  accordance  with  ANSI/ UL 2196-2006, Standard for Tests of Fire-Resistive Cable .
