## 500.5  Classifications of Locations.
- (A)  General. Locations  shall  be  classified  depending  on  the properties  of  the  flammable  gas,  flammable  liquid-produced vapor, combustible liquid-produced vapors, combustible dusts, or fibers/flyings that could be present, and the likelihood that a flammable  or  combustible  concentration  or  quantity  is present. Each room, section, or area shall be considered individually  in  determining  its  classification.  Where  pyrophoric materials  are  the  only  materials  used  or  handled,  these  locations are outside the scope of this article.
Informational Note No. 1: Through the exercise of ingenuity in the  layout  of  electrical  installations  for  hazardous  (classified) locations, it is frequently possible to locate much of the equipment  in  a  reduced  level  of  classification  or  in  an  unclassified
Informational  Note  No.  2:  For  the  requirements  for  electrical and electronic equipment and wiring for all voltages in Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 hazardous (classified) locations where fire or explosion hazards may exist due to flammable gases or vapors or flammable liquids, refer to Article 505.
Informational  Note  No.  3:  For  the  requirements  for  electrical and electronic equipment and wiring for all voltages in Zone 20, Zone  21,  and  Zone  22  hazardous  (classified)  locations  where fire or explosion hazards may exist due to combustible dusts or ignitible fibers/flyings, refer to Article 506.
- 500.3  Other  Articles. Except  as  modified  in  Articles  500 through 504, all other applicable rules contained in this Code shall  apply  to  electrical  equipment  and  wiring  installed  in hazardous (classified) locations.
## 500.4  General.

- (B)  Reference  Standards. Important  information  relating  to topics  covered  in  Chapter  5  may  be  found  in  other  publications.
Informational Note No. 1:  Familiarity with the standards of the National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA),  the  American Petroleum  Institute  (API),  and  the  International  Society  of Automation (ISA), as well as relevant industrial experience, may be of use in the classification of various locations, the determination  of  adequate  ventilation,  and  the  protection  against  static electricity and lightning hazards.
location and, thus, to reduce the amount of special equipment required.
Refrigerant machinery rooms that contain ammonia refrigeration  systems  and  are  equipped  with  adequate  mechanical ventilation that operates continuously or is initiated by a detection system at a concentration not exceeding 150 ppm shall be permitted to be classified as 'unclassified' locations.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  For  further  information  regarding classification  and  ventilation  of  areas  involving  closed-circuit ammonia  refrigeration  systems,  see  ANSI/ASHRAE  15-2013, Safety  Standard  for  Refrigeration  Systems ,  and  ANSI/IIAR  2-2014, Standard  for  Safe  Design  of  Closed-Circuit  Ammonia  Refrigeration Systems .
#### (B)  Class  I  Locations. Class  I  locations  are  those  in  which flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors are or may be present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures.  Class  I  locations  shall  include  those  specified  in 500.5(B)(1) and (B)(2).
(1)  Class I, Division 1. A Class I, Division 1 location is a location:
- (1) In  which  ignitible  concentrations  of  flammable  gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced  vapors  can  exist  under  normal  operating conditions, or
- (2) In  which  ignitible  concentrations  of  flammable  gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors are normally prevented by positive  mechanical  ventilation  and  which  might  become hazardous through failure or abnormal operation of the ventilating equipment, or
- (2) In  which  ignitible  concentrations  of  such  flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquids  above  their  flash  points  may  exist  frequently because of repair or maintenance operations or because of leakage, or
- (3) In which breakdown or faulty operation of equipment or processes might release ignitible concentrations of flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors and might also cause  simultaneous  failure  of  electrical  equipment  in such a way as to directly cause the electrical equipment to become a source of ignition
Informational  Note  No.  1:  This  classification  usually  includes the following locations:
- (1) Where volatile flammable liquids or liquefied flammable gases are transferred from one container to another
- (3) Locations containing open tanks or vats of volatile flammable liquids
- (2) Interiors  of  spray  booths  and  areas  in  the  vicinity  of spraying and painting operations where volatile flammable solvents are used
- (4) Drying  rooms  or  compartments  for  the  evaporation  of flammable solvents
- (6) Portions of cleaning and dyeing plants where flammable liquids are used
- (5) Locations  containing  fat-  and  oil-extraction  equipment using volatile flammable solvents
- (7) Gas generator rooms and other portions of gas manufacturing plants where flammable gas may escape
- (9) The interiors of refrigerators and freezers in which volatile flammable materials are stored in open, lightly stoppered, or easily ruptured containers
- (8) Inadequately ventilated pump rooms for flammable gas or for volatile flammable liquids
- (10) All  other  locations  where  ignitible  concentrations  of flammable  vapors  or  gases  are  likely  to  occur  in  the course of normal operations
Informational Note No. 2: In some Division 1 locations, ignitible concentrations  of  flammable  gases  or  vapors  may  be  present continuously or for long periods of time. Examples include the following:
- (1) The inside of inadequately vented enclosures containing instruments normally venting flammable gases or vapors to the interior of the enclosure
- (3) The area between the inner and outer roof sections of a floating roof tank containing volatile flammable fluids
- (2) The inside of vented tanks containing volatile flammable liquids
- (4) Inadequately  ventilated  areas  within  spraying  or  coating operations using volatile flammable fluids
Experience has demonstrated the prudence of avoiding the installation of instrumentation or other electrical equipment in these particular areas altogether or where it cannot be avoided because it is essential to the process and other locations are not feasible  [see  500.5(A),  Informational  Note]  using  electrical equipment or instrumentation approved for the specific application  or  consisting  of  intrinsically  safe  systems  as  described  in Article 504.
- (5) The interior of an exhaust duct that is used to vent ignitible concentrations of gases or vapors
(2)  Class I, Division 2. A Class I, Division 2 location is a location:
- (1) In  which  volatile  flammable  gases,  flammable  liquidproduced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors are handled, processed, or used, but in which the liquids, vapors,  or  gases  will  normally  be  confined  within  closed containers or closed systems from which they can escape only in case of accidental rupture or breakdown of such containers or systems or in case of abnormal operation of equipment, or
- (3) That is adjacent to a Class I, Division 1 location, and to which ignitible concentrations of flammable gases, flammable  liquid-produced  vapors,  or  combustible  liquidproduced vapors above their flash points might occasionally  be  communicated  unless  such  communication  is prevented by adequate positive-pressure ventilation from a  source  of  clean  air  and  effective  safeguards  against ventilation failure are provided.
Informational  Note  No.  1:  This  classification  usually  includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or flammable gases or vapors  are  used  but  that,  in  the  judgment  of  the  authority having jurisdiction, would become hazardous only in case of an accident or of some unusual operating condition. The quantity of flammable material that might escape in case of accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, the total area involved, and the record of the industry or business with respect to explosions or  fires  are  all  factors  that  merit  consideration  in  determining the classification and extent of each location.
Informational Note No. 2: Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices would not ordinarily introduce a hazardous condition  even  though  used  for  flammable  liquids  or  gases. Depending  on  factors  such  as  the  quantity  and  size  of  the containers  and  ventilation,  locations  used  for  the  storage  of flammable  liquids  or  liquefied  or  compressed  gases  in  sealed containers  may  be  considered  either  hazardous  (classified)  or unclassified locations. See NFPA 30-2015, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code , and NFPA 58-2014, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code .
#### (C)  Class  II  Locations. Class  II  locations  are  those  that  are hazardous because of the presence of combustible dust. Class II locations  shall  include  those  specified  in  500.5(C)(1)  and (C)(2).
(1)  Class II, Division 1. A Class II, Division 1 location is a location:
- (1) In  which  combustible  dust  is  in  the  air  under  normal operating  conditions  in  quantities  sufficient  to  produce explosive or ignitible mixtures, or
- (3) In  which  Group  E  combustible  dusts  may  be  present  in quantities sufficient to be hazardous.
- (2) Where  mechanical  failure  or  abnormal  operation  of machinery or  equipment  might  cause  such  explosive  or ignitible mixtures to be produced, and might also provide a source of ignition through simultaneous failure of electrical  equipment,  through  operation  of  protection  devices, or from other causes, or
Informational Note: Dusts containing magnesium or aluminum are particularly hazardous, and the use of extreme precaution is necessary to avoid ignition and explosion.
(2)  Class II, Division 2. A Class II, Division 2 location is a location:
- (1) In  which  combustible  dust  due  to  abnormal  operations may  be  present  in  the  air  in  quantities  sufficient  to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures; or

(2)  Class  III,  Division  2. A Class  III,  Division  2  location  is  a location  in  which  easily  ignitible  fibers/flyings  are  stored  or handled other than in the process of manufacture.
### 500.6  Material Groups. For purposes of testing, approval, and area classification, various air mixtures (not oxygen-enriched) shall be grouped in accordance with 500.6(A) and (B).
Exception: Equipment identified for a specific gas, vapor, dust, or fiber/ flying.
Informational Note: This grouping is based on the characteristics of the materials. Facilities are available for testing and identifying equipment for use in the various atmospheric groups.
#### (A)  Class  I  Group  Classifications. Class  I  groups  shall  be according to 500.6(A)(1) through (A)(4).
Informational  Note  No.  1:  Informational  Note  Nos.  2  and  3 apply to 500.6(A).
Informational  Note  No.  2:  The  explosion  characteristics  of  air mixtures  of  gases  or  vapors  vary  with  the  specific  material involved. For Class I locations, Groups A, B, C, and D, the classification  involves  determinations  of  maximum  explosion  pressure and maximum safe clearance between parts of a clamped joint in an enclosure. It is necessary, therefore, that equipment be identified not only for class but also for the specific group of the gas or vapor that will be present.
Informational  Note  No.  3:  Certain  chemical  atmospheres  may have characteristics that require safeguards beyond those required for any of the Class I groups. Carbon disulfide is one of these  chemicals  because  of  its  low  autoignition  temperature (90°C)  and  the  small  joint  clearance  permitted  to  arrest  its flame.
- (3) In which combustible dust accumulations on, in, or in the vicinity of the electrical equipment could be sufficient to interfere with the safe dissipation of heat from electrical equipment, or could be ignitible by abnormal operation or failure of electrical equipment.

- (2) Where  combustible  dust  accumulations  are  present  but are  normally  insufficient  to  interfere  with  the  normal operation of electrical equipment or other apparatus, but could as a result of infrequent malfunctioning of handling or processing equipment become suspended in the air; or
Informational Note No. 1: The quantity of combustible dust that may be present and the adequacy of dust removal systems are factors that merit consideration in determining the classification and may result in an unclassified area.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  Where  products  such  as  seed  are handled in a manner that produces low quantities of dust, the amount of dust deposited may not warrant classification.
#### (D)  Class III Locations. Class III locations are those that are hazardous because of the presence of easily ignitible fibers or where  materials  producing  combustible  flyings  are  handled, manufactured, or used, but in which such fibers/flyings are not likely  to  be  in  suspension  in  the  air  in  quantities  sufficient  to produce  ignitible  mixtures.  Class  III  locations  shall  include those specified in 500.5(D)(1) and (D)(2).
(1)  Class  III,  Division  1. A Class  III,  Division  1  location  is  a location  in  which  easily  ignitible  fibers/flyings  are  handled, manufactured, or used.
Informational Note No. 1: Such locations usually include some parts  of  rayon,  cotton,  and  other  textile  mills;  combustible fibers/flyings manufacturing and processing plants; cotton gins and cotton-seed mills; flax-processing plants; clothing manufacturing  plants;  woodworking  plants;  and  establishments  and industries involving similar hazardous processes or conditions.
(2)  Group  B. Flammable  gas,  flammable  liquid-produced vapor,  or  combustible  liquid-produced  vapor  mixed  with  air that  may  burn  or  explode,  having  either  a  maximum  experimental safe gap (MESG) value less than or equal to 0.45 mm or a  minimum  igniting  current  ratio  (MIC  ratio)  less  than  or equal to 0.40. [ 497: 3.3.5.1.2]
Informational Note: A typical Class I, Group B material is hydrogen.
Exception No. 1: Group D equipment shall be permitted to be used for atmospheres  containing  butadiene,  provided  all  conduit  runs  into explosionproof equipment are provided with explosionproof seals installed within 450 mm (18 in.) of the enclosure.
Exception No. 2: Group C equipment shall be permitted to be used for atmospheres containing allyl glycidyl ether, n-butyl glycidyl ether, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and acrolein, provided all conduit runs into explosionproof equipment are provided with explosionproof seals installed within 450 mm (18 in.) of the enclosure.
(3)  Group  C. Flammable  gas,  flammable  liquid-produced vapor,  or  combustible  liquid-produced  vapor  mixed  with  air that  may  burn  or  explode,  having  either  a  maximum  experimental safe gap (MESG) value greater than 0.45 mm and less than or equal to 0.75 mm, or a minimum igniting current ratio (MIC ratio) greater than 0.40 and less than or equal to 0.80. [ 497: 3.3.5.1.3]
Informational Note: A typical Class I, Group C material is ethylene.
(4)  Group  D. Flammable  gas,  flammable  liquid-produced vapor,  or  combustible  liquid-produced  vapor  mixed  with  air that  may  burn  or  explode,  having  either  a  maximum  experimental safe gap (MESG) value greater than 0.75 mm or a minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio greater than 0.80. [ 497: 3.3.5.1.4]
Informational Note No. 1: A typical Class I, Group D material is propane. [ 497: 3.3.5.1.4]
Informational  Note  No.  2:  For  classification  of  areas  involving ammonia atmospheres, see ANSI/ASHRAE 15-2013, Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems .
#### (B)  Class II Group Classifications. Class II groups shall be in accordance with 500.6(B)(1) through (B)(3).
(1)  Group  E. Atmospheres  containing  combustible  metal dusts, including aluminum, magnesium, and their commercial alloys, or other combustible dusts whose particle size, abrasiveness,  and  conductivity  present  similar  hazards  in  the  use  of electrical equipment. [ 499: 3.3.4.1]
Informational  Note:  Certain  metal  dusts  may  have  characteristics  that  require  safeguards  beyond  those  required  for  atmospheres containing the dusts of aluminum, magnesium, and their commercial alloys. For example, zirconium, thorium,  and uranium dusts have extremely low ignition temperatures [as low as 20°C (68°F)] and minimum ignition energies lower than any material classified in any of the Class I or Class II groups. (F)  Nonincendive Circuit. This protection technique shall be permitted for equipment in Class I, Division 2; Class II, Division 2; or Class III, Division 1 or 2 locations.
(2)  Group  F. Atmospheres  containing  combustible  carbonaceous dusts that have more than 8 percent total entrapped volatiles (see ASTM D3175-11, Standard Test Method for Volatile Matter in the Analysis Sample for Coal and Coke , for coal and coke dusts) or  that  have  been  sensitized  by  other  materials  so  that  they present an explosion hazard. [ 499: 3.3.4.2] Coal, carbon black, charcoal, and coke dusts are examples of carbonaceous dusts. [ 499: A.3.3.4.2]
Informational Note: Testing of specific dust samples, following established ASTM testing procedures, is a method used to identify the combustibility of a specific dust and the need to classify those locations containing that material as Group F.
(3)  Group G. Atmospheres containing combustible dusts not included in Group E or Group F, including flour, grain, wood, plastic, and chemicals. [ 499: 3.3.4.3]
Informational Note No. 1: For additional information on group classification of Class II materials, see NFPA 499-2013, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations  in  Chemical Process Areas .
Informational  Note  No.  2:  The  explosion  characteristics  of  air mixtures  of  dust  vary  with  the  materials  involved.  For  Class  II locations,  Groups  E,  F,  and  G,  the  classification  involves  the tightness of the joints of assembly and shaft openings to prevent the  entrance  of  dust  in  the  dust-ignitionproof  enclosure,  the blanketing  effect  of  layers  of  dust  on  the  equipment  that  may cause overheating, and the ignition temperature of the dust. It is necessary, therefore, that equipment be identified not only for the  class  but  also  for  the  specific  group  of  dust  that  will  be present.
Informational Note No. 3: Certain dusts may require additional precautions due to chemical phenomena that can result in the generation of ignitible gases. See ANSI/IEEE C2-2012, National Electrical Safety Code , Section 127A, Coal Handling Areas.

Informational  Note  No.  1:  Seals  are  provided  in  conduit  and cable systems to minimize the passage of gases and vapors and prevent the passage of flames from one portion of the electrical installation  to  another  through  the  conduit.  Such  communication through Type MI cable is inherently prevented by construction of the cable. Unless specifically designed and tested for the purpose,  conduit  and  cable  seals  are  not  intended  to  prevent the passage of liquids, gases, or vapors at a continuous pressure differential across the seal. Even at differences in pressure across the seal equivalent to a few inches of water, there may be a slow passage of gas or vapor through a seal and through conductors passing  through  the  seal.  Temperature  extremes  and  highly corrosive  liquids  and  vapors  can  affect  the  ability  of  seals  to perform their intended function.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  Gas  or  vapor  leakage  and  propagation  of  flames  may  occur  through  the  interstices  between  the strands  of  standard  stranded  conductors  larger  than  2  AWG. Special conductor constructions, such as compacted strands or sealing of the individual strands, are means of reducing leakage and preventing the propagation of flames.
#### (A)  Conduit  Seals,  Class  I,  Division  1. In  Class  I,  Division  1 locations,  conduit  seals  shall  be  located  in  accordance  with 501.15(A)(1) through (A)(4).
(1)  Entering  Enclosures. Each  conduit  entry  into  an  explosionproof enclosure shall have a conduit seal where either of the following conditions apply:
- (1) The  enclosure contains apparatus, such as switches, circuit breakers, fuses, relays, or resistors that  may produce arcs, sparks, or temperatures that exceed 80  percent  of  the  autoignition  temperature,  in  degrees Celsius, of the gas or vapor involved in normal operation.
Exception: Seals shall not be required for conduit entering an enclosure under any one of the following conditions:
- a. The switch, circuit breaker, fuse, relay, or resistor is enclosed within a  chamber  hermetically  sealed  against  the  entrance  of  gases  or vapors.
- c. The switch, circuit breaker, fuse, relay, or resistor is enclosed within an  enclosure,  identified  for  the  location,  and  marked  'Leads Factory Sealed,' or 'Factory Sealed,' 'Seal not Required,' or equivalent.
- b. The switch, circuit breaker, fuse, relay, or resistor is immersed in oil in accordance with 501.115(B)(1)(2).
- d. The switch, circuit breaker, fuse, relay, or resistor is part of a nonincendive circuit.
- (2) The entry is metric designator 53 (trade size 2) or larger, and the enclosure contains terminals, splices, or taps.
An enclosure, identified for the location, and marked 'Leads Factory Sealed', or 'Factory Sealed,' or 'Seal not Required,' or equivalent shall not be considered to serve as a seal for another adjacent enclosure that is required to have a conduit seal.
Conduit seals shall be installed within 450 mm (18 in.) from the  enclosure  or  as  required  by  the  enclosure  marking.  Only explosionproof unions, couplings, reducers, elbows, and capped  elbows  that  are  not  larger  than  the  trade  size  of  the conduit shall be permitted between the sealing fitting and the explosionproof enclosure.
(2)  Pressurized  Enclosures. Conduit  seals  shall  be  installed within 450 mm (18 in.) of the enclosure in each conduit entry into a pressurized enclosure where the conduit is not pressurized as part of the protection system.
Informational Note No. 1: Installing the seal as close as possible to  the  enclosure  will  reduce  problems  with  purging  the  dead airspace in the pressurized conduit.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  For  further  information,  see  NFPA 496-2013, Standard for Purged and Pressurized Enclosures for Electrical Equipment.
(3)  Two  or  More  Explosionproof  Enclosures. Where two or more explosionproof enclosures that require conduit seals are connected  by  nipples  or  runs  of  conduit  not  more  than 900 mm (36 in.) long, a single conduit seal in each such nipple connection or run of conduit shall be considered sufficient if the seal is located not more than 450 mm (18 in.) from either enclosure.

For the purposes of this section, high temperatures shall be considered to be any temperatures exceeding 80  percent  of  the  autoignition  temperature  in  degrees Celsius of the gas or vapor involved.
(c)     Are enclosed within an enclosure, identified for the location, and marked 'Leads Factory Sealed,' 'Factory Sealed,' 'Seal not Required,' or equivalent.
Informational  Note  No.  1:  Seals  are  provided  in  conduit  and cable systems to minimize the passage of gases and vapors and prevent the passage of flames from one portion of the electrical installation  to  another  through  the  conduit.  Such  communication through Type MI cable is inherently prevented by construction of the cable. Unless specifically designed and tested for the purpose,  conduit  and  cable  seals  are  not  intended  to  prevent the passage of liquids, gases, or vapors at a continuous pressure differential across the seal. Even at differences in pressure across the seal equivalent to a few inches of water, there may be a slow passage of gas or vapor through a seal and through conductors passing  through  the  seal.  See  505.16(C)(2)(b).  Temperature extremes and highly corrosive liquids and vapors can affect the ability of seals to perform their intended function. See 505.16(D)(2). Exception:  Seals shall not be required for conduit entering an enclosure where such switches, circuit breakers, fuses, relays, or resistors comply with one of the following: (a)     Are enclosed within a chamber hermetically sealed against the entrance of gases or vapors. (b)     Are immersed in oil.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  Gas  or  vapor  leakage  and  propagation  of  flames  may  occur  through  the  interstices  between  the strands  of  standard  stranded  conductors  larger  than  2  AWG. Special conductor constructions, for example, compacted strands or sealing of the individual strands, are means of reducing leakage and preventing the propagation of flames.

## 506.5  Classification of Locations.
#### (A)  Classifications  of  Locations. Locations shall be classified on the basis of the properties of the combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings that may be present, and the likelihood that a combustible or combustible concentration or quantity is present. Each room, section, or area shall be considered individually  in  determining  its  classification.  Where  pyrophoric materials  are  the  only  materials  used  or  handled,  these  locations are outside of the scope of this article.
#### (B)  Zone  20,  Zone  21,  and  Zone  22  Locations. Zone  20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 locations are those in which combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are or may be present in the air or  in  layers,  in  quantities  sufficient  to  produce  explosive  or ignitible  mixtures.  Zone  20,  Zone  21,  and  Zone  22  locations shall  include  those  specified  in  506.5(B)(1),  (B)(2),  and  (B) (3).
Informational  Note:  Through  the  exercise  of  ingenuity  in  the layout  of  electrical  installations  for  hazardous  (classified)  locations, it is frequently possible to locate much of the equipment in  a  reduced  level  of  classification  and,  thus,  to  reduce  the amount of special equipment required.
- (1)  Zone 20. A Zone 20 location is a location in which either of the following occur:
- (1) Ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible fibers/flyings are present continuously.
3. Informational Note No. 1: As a guide to classification of Zone 20 locations,  refer  to  ANSI/ISA-60079-10-2  (12.10.05)-2013, Explosive  Atmospheres  -  Part  10-2:  Classification  of  areas  -  Combustible dust atmospheres . (3) The  location  is  adjacent  to  a  Zone  21  location,  from which  ignitible  concentrations  of  dust  or  fibers/flyings could be communicated.
- (2) Ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible fibers/flyings are present for long periods of time.
Informational Note No. 2: Zone 20 classification includes locations inside dust containment systems; hoppers, silos, etc., cyclones and filters, dust transport systems, except some parts of belt and chain conveyors, etc.; blenders, mills, dryers, bagging equipment, etc.
- (2)  Zone  21. A Zone 21 location is  a  location  where  one  of the following apply:
- (1) Ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible fibers/flyings are likely to exist occasionally under normal operating conditions; or
- (3) Equipment  is  operated  or  processes  are  carried  on,  of such a nature that equipment breakdown or faulty operations  could  result  in  the  release  of  ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible  fibers/flyings  and also cause simultaneous failure of electrical equipment in a  mode  to  cause  the  electrical  equipment  to  become  a source of ignition; or
- (2) Ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible fibers/flyings  may  exist  frequently  because  of  repair  or maintenance operations or because of leakage; or
- (4) The location is adjacent to a Zone 20 location from which ignitible concentrations of dust or ignitible fibers/flyings could be communicated.
Exception:  When communication from an adjacent Zone 20 location is minimized  by  adequate  positive  pressure  ventilation  from  a  source  of clean air, and effective safeguards against ventilation failure are provided.
Informational Note No. 1: As a guide to classification of Zone 21 locations,  refer  to  ANSI/ISA-60079-10-2  (12.10.05)-2013, Explosive  Atmospheres  -  Part  10-2:  Classification  of  areas  -  Combustible dust atmospheres .
Informational  Note  No.  2:  This  classification  usually  includes locations outside dust containment and in the immediate vicinity  of  access  doors  subject  to  frequent  removal  or  opening  for operation  purposes  when  internal  combustible  mixtures  are present; locations outside dust containment in the proximity of filling  and  emptying  points,  feed  belts,  sampling  points,  truck dump stations, belt dump over points, etc., where no measures are employed to prevent the formation of combustible mixtures; locations outside dust containment where dust accumulates and where  due  to  process  operations  the  dust  layer  is  likely  to  be disturbed and form combustible mixtures; locations inside dust containment where explosive dust clouds are likely to occur (but neither  continuously,  nor  for  long  periods,  nor  frequently)  as, for  example,  silos  (if  filled  and/or  emptied  only  occasionally) and  the  dirty  side  of  filters  if  large  self-cleaning  intervals  are occurring.
- (3)  Zone  22. A Zone 22 location is  a  location  where  one  of the following apply:
- (1) Ignitible  concentrations  of  combustible  dust  or  ignitible fibers/flyings are not likely to occur in normal operation and, if they do occur, will only persist for a short period; or
- (2) Combustible dust or fibers/flyings are handled, processed, or used but in which the dust or fibers/flyings are normally confined within closed containers of closed systems from which they can escape only as a result of the abnormal  operation  of  the  equipment  with  which  the dust or fibers/flyings are handled, processed, or used; or
Exception:  When communication from an adjacent Zone 21 location is minimized  by  adequate  positive  pressure  ventilation  from  a  source  of clean air, and effective safeguards against ventilation failure are provided.
Informational Note No. 1: As a guide to classification of Zone 22 locations,  refer  to  ANSI/ISA-60079-10-2  (12.10.05)-2013, Explosive  Atmospheres  -  Part  10-2:  Classification  of  areas  -  Combustible dust atmospheres .
Informational  Note  No.  2:  Zone  22  locations  usually  include outlets from bag filter vents, because in the event of a malfunction  there  can  be  emission  of  combustible  mixtures;  locations near equipment that has to be opened at infrequent intervals or equipment  that  from  experience  can  easily  form  leaks  where, due  to  pressure  above  atmospheric,  dust  will  blow  out;  pneumatic equipment, flexible connections that can become damaged, etc.; storage locations for bags containing dusty product,  since  failure  of  bags  can  occur  during  handling,  causing dust  leakage;  and  locations  where  controllable  dust  layers  are formed  that  are  likely  to  be  raised  into  explosive  dust-air mixtures. Only if the layer is removed by cleaning before hazardous  dust-air  mixtures  can  be  formed  is  the  area  designated unclassified.
Informational Note No. 3: Locations that normally are classified as Zone 21 can fall into Zone 22 when measures are employed to  prevent  the  formation  of  explosive  dust-air  mixtures.  Such measures include exhaust ventilation. The measures should be used  in  the  vicinity  of  (bag)  filling  and  emptying  points,  feed
belts,  sampling  points,  truck  dump  stations,  belt  dump  over points, etc.
### 506.6  Material Groups. For the purposes of testing, approval, and area classification, various air mixtures (not  oxygen enriched) shall be grouped as required in 506.6(A), (B), and (C).
#### (A)  Group IIIC. Combustible metal dust. Group IIIC shall be considered to be equivalent to Class II, Group E.

## Part II. Wiring and Protection
### 517.10  Applicability.
#### (A)  Applicability. Part II shall apply to patient care space of all health care facilities.
- (B)  Not Covered. Part II shall not apply to the following:
- (1) Business offices, corridors, waiting rooms, and the like in clinics,  medical  and  dental  offices,  and  outpatient  facilities
- (2) Areas of nursing homes and limited care facilities wired in  accordance  with  Chapters  1  through  4  of  this Code where these areas are used exclusively as patient sleeping rooms
Informational Note: See NFPA 101 -2015, Life Safety Code ® .
### 517.11  General  Installation  -  Construction  Criteria. The purpose of this article is to specify the installation criteria and wiring methods that minimize electrical hazards by the maintenance  of  adequately  low  potential  differences  only  between exposed  conductive  surfaces  that  are  likely  to  become  energized and could be contacted by a patient.
Informational  Note:  In  a  health  care  facility,  it  is  difficult  to prevent the occurrence of a conductive or capacitive path from the patient's body to some grounded object, because that path may  be  established  accidentally  or  through  instrumentation
directly connected to the patient. Other electrically conductive surfaces that may make an additional contact with the patient, or  instruments  that  may  be  connected  to  the  patient,  then become  possible  sources  of  electric  currents  that  can  traverse the patient's body. The hazard is increased as more apparatus is associated  with  the  patient,  and,  therefore,  more  intensive precautions are needed. Control of electric shock  hazard requires the limitation of electric current that might flow in an electrical circuit involving the patient's body by raising the resistance  of  the  conductive  circuit  that  includes  the  patient,  or  by insulating  exposed  surfaces  that  might  become  energized,  in addition  to  reducing  the  potential  difference  that  can  appear between exposed conductive surfaces in the patient care vicinity, or  by  combinations  of  these  methods.  A  special  problem  is presented by the patient with an externalized direct conductive path  to  the  heart  muscle.  The  patient  may  be  electrocuted  at current levels so low that additional protection in the design of appliances,  insulation  of  the  catheter,  and  control  of  medical practice is required.
### 517.12  Wiring  Methods. Except  as  modified  in  this  article, wiring methods shall comply with the applicable provisions of Chapters 1 through 4 of this Code .
### 517.13  Grounding of Receptacles and Fixed Electrical Equipment  in  Patient  Care  Spaces. Wiring  in  patient  care  spaces shall comply with 517.13(A) and (B).
#### (A)  Wiring Methods. All  branch  circuits  serving  patient  care spaces shall be provided with an effective ground-fault current path by installation in a metal raceway system or a cable having a metallic armor or sheath assembly. The metal raceway system, metallic  cable  armor,  or  sheath  assembly  shall  itself  qualify  as an equipment grounding conductor in accordance with 250.118.
## (B)  Insulated Equipment Grounding Conductors and Insulated Equipment Bonding Jumpers.
- (1) The  grounding  terminals  of  all  receptacles  other  than isolated ground receptacles
### 517.14  Panelboard Bonding. The equipment grounding terminal  buses  of  the  normal  and  essential  branch-circuit panelboards  serving  the  same  individual  patient  care  vicinity shall  be  connected  together  with  an  insulated  continuous copper  conductor  not  smaller  than  10  AWG.  Where  two  or more  panelboards  serving  the  same  individual  patient  care vicinity are served from separate transfer switches on the essential electrical system, the equipment grounding terminal buses of those panelboards shall be connected together with an insulated continuous copper conductor not smaller than 10 AWG. This  conductor  shall  be  permitted  to  be  broken  in  order  to terminate on the equipment grounding terminal bus in each panelboard.
## 517.16  Use of Isolated Ground Receptacles.

- (1) The  grounding  terminals  of  isolated  ground  receptacles installed  in  branch  circuits  for  patient  care  spaces  shall  be connected to an insulated equipment grounding conductor in accordance  with  250.146(D)  in  addition  to  the  equipment grounding conductor path required in 517.13(A). N
The  equipment  grounding  conductor  connected  to  the grounding terminals of isolated ground receptacles in patient care  spaces  shall  be  clearly  identified  along  the  equipment grounding conductor's entire length by green insulation with one or more yellow stripes.
- (1)  General. The following shall be directly connected to an insulated  copper  equipment  grounding  conductor  that  is clearly  identified  along  its  entire  length  by  green  insulation and installed with the branch circuit conductors in the wiring methods as provided in 517.13(A): (2) The insulated grounding conductor required in 517.13(B)(1) shall be clearly identified along its entire length by  green  insulation,  with  no  yellow  stripes,  and  shall  not  be connected  to  the  grounding  terminals  of  isolated  ground receptacles but shall be connected to the box or enclosure indicated in 517.13(B)(1)(2) and to non-current-carrying conductive surfaces of fixed electrical equipment indicated in 517.13(B)(1)(3).

For 3-phase systems, the third conductor shall be identified as yellow with at least one distinctive colored stripe other than white, green, or gray along the entire length of the conductor. Where isolated circuit conductors supply 125-volt, single-phase, 15-  and  20-ampere  receptacles,  the  striped  orange  conductor(s) shall be connected to the terminal(s) on the receptacles that  are  identified  in  accordance  with  200.10(B)  for  connection to the grounded circuit conductor.
(6)  Wire-Pulling  Compounds. Wire-pulling  compounds  that increase the dielectric constant shall not be used on the secondary conductors of the isolated power supply.
Informational Note No. 1: It is desirable to limit the size of the isolation  transformer  to  10  kVA  or  less  and  to  use  conductor insulation with low leakage to meet impedance requirements.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  Minimizing  the  length  of  branchcircuit conductors and using conductor insulations with a dielectric  constant  less  than  3.5  and  insulation  resistance  constant greater  than  6100  megohm-meters  (20,000  megohm-feet)  at 16°C (60°F) reduces leakage from line to ground, reducing the hazard current.
## (B)  Line Isolation Monitor.
(3)  Equipment  Location. The  isolating  transformers,  motor generator  sets,  batteries  and  battery  chargers,  and  associated primary or secondary overcurrent devices shall not be installed in  hazardous  (classified)  locations.

In addition to the usual control and overcurrent protective devices, each isolated power system shall be provided with a listed continually operating line isolation monitor  that  indicates  total  hazard  current.  The  monitor  shall  be designed such that a green signal lamp, conspicuously visible to persons  in  each  area  served  by  the  isolated  power  system, remains  lighted  when  the  system  is  adequately  isolated  from ground. An adjacent red signal lamp and an audible warning signal  (remote  if  desired)  shall  be  energized  when  the  total hazard  current  (consisting  of  possible  resistive  and  capacitive leakage  currents)  from  either  isolated  conductor  to  ground reaches a threshold value of 5 mA under nominal line voltage conditions. The line monitor shall not alarm for a fault hazard of  less  than  3.7  mA  or  for  a  total  hazard  current  of  less  than 5 mA.
(a) Induction  Rooms. Where  an  induction  room  serves more  than  one  operating  room,  the  isolated  circuits  of  the induction  room  shall  be  permitted  to  be  supplied  from  the isolation transformer of any one of the operating rooms served by that induction room.

- (1) The  receptacles  are  reserved  for  supplying  power  to equipment requiring 150 volts or higher, such as portable X-ray units.
[ 99: 13.4.1.2.6.6]
- (2) The receptacles and mating plugs are not interchangeable  with  the  receptacles  on  the  local  isolated  power system.
Exception:  A  system  shall  be  permitted  to  be  designed  to  operate  at  a lower threshold value of total hazard current. A line isolation monitor for such a system shall be permitted to be approved, with the provision that the fault hazard current shall be permitted to be reduced but not to less  than  35  percent  of  the  corresponding  threshold  value  of  the  total hazard current, and the monitor hazard current is to be correspondingly reduced to not more than 50 percent of the alarm threshold value of the total hazard current.
(2)  Impedance. The line isolation monitor shall be designed to have sufficient internal impedance such that, when properly connected  to  the isolated  system,  the  maximum  internal current that can flow through the line isolation monitor, when any point of the isolated system is grounded, shall be 1 mA.
Exception: The line isolation monitor shall be permitted to be of the lowimpedance type such that the current through the line isolation monitor,
when any point of the isolated system is grounded, will not exceed twice the alarm threshold value for a period not exceeding 5 milliseconds.
Informational Note: Reduction of the monitor hazard current, provided  this  reduction  results  in  an  increased  'not  alarm' threshold value for the fault hazard current, will increase circuit capacity.
(3)  Ammeter. An  ammeter  calibrated  in  the  total  hazard current of the system (contribution of the fault hazard current plus monitor hazard current) shall be mounted in a plainly visible  place  on  the  line  isolation  monitor  with  the  'alarm  on' zone at approximately the center of the scale.
Exception: The line isolation monitor shall be permitted to be a composite  unit,  with  a  sensing  section  cabled  to  a  separate  display  panel section on which the alarm or test functions are located.
Informational Note: It is desirable to locate the ammeter so that it  is  conspicuously  visible  to  persons  in  the  anesthetizing  location.

Informational  Note:  Due  to  the  long  circuit  lengths  typical  in most recreational vehicle parks, feeder conductor sizes found in the ampacity tables of Article 310 may be inadequate to maintain  the  voltage  regulation  suggested  in  215.2(A)(1)  Informational  Note  No.  2.  Total  circuit  voltage  drop  is  a  sum  of  the voltage drops of each serial circuit segment, where the load for each segment is calculated using the load that segment sees and the demand factors shown in Table 551.73(A).
## 551.73  Calculated Load.
#### (A)  Basis of Calculations. Electrical services and feeders shall be calculated on the basis of not less than 12,000 volt-amperes per  site  equipped  with  50-ampere,  208Y/120  or  120/240-volt supply facilities; 3600 volt-amperes per site equipped with both 20-ampere  and  30-ampere  supply  facilities;  2400  volt-amperes per  site  equipped  with  only  20-ampere  supply  facilities;  and 600 volt-amperes per site equipped with only 20-ampere supply facilities  that  are  dedicated  to  tent  sites.  The  demand  factors set  forth  in  Table  551.73(A)  shall  be  the  minimum  allowable demand factors that shall be permitted in calculating load for service  and  feeders.  Where  the  electrical  supply  for  a  recreational vehicle site has more than one receptacle, the calculated load shall be calculated only for the highest rated receptacle.
Where the electrical  supply  is  in  a  location  that  serves  two recreational vehicles, the equipment for both sites shall comply with 551.77, and the calculated load shall only be calculated for the two receptacles with the highest rating.
Informational Note: The percentage of 50 ampere sites required by 551.71 could be inadequate for seasonal recreational vehicle sites  serving  a  higher  percentage  of  recreational  vehicles  with 50 ampere electrical systems. In that type of recreational vehicle park, the percentage of 50 ampere  sites  could  approach 100 percent. Informational Note: These demand factors may be inadequate in areas of extreme hot or cold temperature with loaded circuits for heating or air conditioning.
## 551.72  Distribution System.
- (A)  Systems. Distribution  systems  shall  provide  the  voltage and have a capacity for the receptacles provided in the recreational vehicle (RV) site supply equipment as calculated according  to  551.73  and  shall  have  an  ampacity  not  less  than 30  amperes.  Systems  permitted  include  120  volts,  1-phase; 120/240 volts, 1-phase; and 120/208 volts, 1-phase. N
- (B)  Three-Phase  Systems. Feeders from  208Y/120-volt,  3phase  systems  shall  be  permitted  to  include  two  ungrounded conductors  and  shall  include  one  grounded  conductor  and one equipment grounding conductor. So far as practicable, the loads shall be equally distributed on the 3-phase system. N
#### (C)  Receptacles. Receptacles  rated  at  50  amperes  shall  be supplied from a branch circuit of the voltage class and rating of the  receptacle.  Other  recreational  vehicle  sites  with  125-volt, 20- and 30-ampere receptacles shall be permitted to be derived from any grounded distribution system that supplies  120-volt, single-phase power. The  neutral conductors shall not  be reduced in size below the size of the ungrounded conductors for the site distribution.
#### (D)  Neutral Conductors. Neutral conductors shall be permitted to be reduced in size below the minimum required size of the  ungrounded  conductors  for  240-volt,  line-to-line,  permanently connected loads only.
- (B)  Demand Factors. The demand factor for a given number of sites shall apply to all sites indicated. For example, 20 sites calculated  at  45  percent  of  3600  volt-amperes  results  in  a permissible demand of 1620 volt-amperes per site or a total of 32,400 volt-amperes for 20 sites. ·
Loads for other amenities such as, but not limited to, service buildings, recreational buildings, and swimming pools shall be calculated separately and then be added to the value calculated for the recreational vehicle sites where they are all supplied by a common service.
- 551.74  Overcurrent Protection. Overcurrent protection shall be provided in accordance with Article 240. ·
