## 90.1  Purpose.
#### (A)  Practical  Safeguarding. The  purpose  of  this Code is  the practical  safeguarding  of  persons  and  property  from  hazards arising from the use of electricity. This Code is not intended as a design  specification  or  an  instruction  manual  for  untrained persons.
#### (B)  Adequacy. This Code contains  provisions  that  are  considered  necessary  for  safety.  Compliance  therewith  and  proper maintenance  result  in  an  installation  that  is  essentially  free from  hazard  but not necessarily efficient, convenient,  or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use.
Informational Note: Hazards often occur because of overloading of  wiring  systems  by  methods  or  usage  not  in  conformity  with this Code .  This occurs because initial wiring did not provide for increases in the use of electricity. An initial adequate installation and reasonable provisions for system changes provide for future increases in the use of electricity.

By special permission, the authority having jurisdiction may waive  specific  requirements  in  this Code or  permit  alternative methods where it is assured that  equivalent  objectives  can  be achieved by establishing and maintaining effective safety.
## 90.5  Mandatory  Rules,  Permissive  Rules,  and  Explanatory Material.
- (A)  Mandatory Rules. Mandatory rules of this Code are those that identify actions that are specifically required or prohibited and are characterized by the use of the terms shall or shall not .
- (B)  Permissive Rules. Permissive rules of this Code are  those that  identify  actions  that  are  allowed  but  not  required,  are normally used to describe options or alternative methods, and are  characterized  by  the  use  of  the  terms shall  be  permitted or shall not be required .
- (C)  Explanatory Material. Explanatory material, such as references to other standards, references to related sections of this Code, or  information related to a Code rule, is included in this Code in the form of informational notes. Such notes are informational only and are not enforceable as requirements of this Code .
Brackets  containing  section  references  to  another  NFPA document are for informational purposes only and are provided  as  a  guide  to  indicate  the  source  of  the  extracted  text. These  bracketed  references  immediately  follow  the  extracted text.
Informational Note: The format and language used in this Code follows  guidelines  established  by  NFPA  and  published  in  the NEC Style Manual .  Copies of this manual can be obtained from NFPA.
- (D)  Informative  Annexes. Nonmandatory  information  relative to the use of the NEC is  provided in informative annexes.
Informative  annexes  are  not  part  of  the  enforceable  requirements of the NEC ,  but  are  included for information purposes only.
### 90.6  Formal Interpretations. To promote uniformity of interpretation and application of the provisions of this Code, formal interpretation procedures have been established and are found in the NFPA Regulations Governing Committee Projects.
### 90.7  Examination of Equipment for Safety. For specific items of equipment and materials referred to in this Code ,  examinations for safety made under standard conditions provide a basis for  approval  where  the  record  is  made  generally  available through promulgation by organizations properly equipped and qualified  for  experimental  testing,  inspections  of  the  run  of goods  at  factories,  and  service-value  determination  through field  inspections.  This  avoids  the  necessity  for  repetition  of examinations  by  different  examiners,  frequently  with  inadequate  facilities  for  such  work,  and  the  confusion  that  would result from conflicting reports on the suitability of devices and materials examined for a given purpose.
It  is  the  intent  of  this Code that  factory-installed  internal wiring or the construction of equipment need not be inspected at  the  time  of  installation  of  the  equipment,  except  to  detect alterations  or  damage,  if  the  equipment  has  been  listed  by  a qualified  electrical  testing  laboratory  that  is  recognized  as having the facilities described in the preceding paragraph and that requires suitability for installation in accordance with this Code .  Suitability shall be determined by application of requirements that are compatible with this Code .
Informational Note No. 1: See requirements in 110.3.
## 90.8  Wiring Planning.
## 90.9  Units of Measurement.
#### (A)  Measurement System of Preference. For  the  purpose  of this Code , metric units of measurement are in accordance with the  modernized  metric  system  known  as  the  International System of Units (SI).
#### (B)  Dual System of Units. SI units shall appear first, and inchpound units shall  immediately  follow  in  parentheses.  Conversion from inch-pound units to SI units shall be based on hard conversion except as provided in 90.9(C).
#### (C)  Permitted  Uses  of  Soft  Conversion. The  cases  given  in 90.9(C)(1) through (C)(4) shall not be required to use hard conversion and shall be permitted to use soft conversion.
(1)  Trade Sizes. Where the actual measured size of a product is not the same as the nominal size, trade size designators shall be  used  rather  than  dimensions.  Trade  practices  shall  be followed in all cases.
(2)  Extracted  Material. Where  material  is  extracted  from another standard, the context of the original material shall not be compromised or violated. Any editing of the extracted text shall be confined to making the style consistent with that of the NEC .
(3)  Industry  Practice. Where  industry  practice  is  to  express units in inch-pound units, the inclusion of SI units shall not be required.
(4)  Safety. Where  a  negative  impact  on  safety  would  result, soft conversion shall be used.
Informational Note No. 2: Listed is defined in Article 100. Informational Note No. 3: Informative Annex A contains a list of product safety standards that are compatible with this Code . (D)  Compliance. Conversion  from  inch-pound  units  to  SI units  shall  be  permitted  to  be  an  approximate  conversion. Compliance with the numbers shown in either the SI system or the  inch-pound  system  shall  constitute  compliance  with  this Code .
#### (A)  Future Expansion and Convenience. Plans and specifications that provide ample space in raceways, spare raceways, and additional  spaces  allow  for  future  increases  in  electric  power and  communications  circuits.  Distribution  centers  located  in readily  accessible  locations  provide  convenience  and  safety  of operation.
#### (B)  Number of Circuits  in  Enclosures. It  is  elsewhere  provided in this Code that the number of circuits confined in a single enclosure  be  varyingly  restricted.  Limiting  the  number  of circuits in a single enclosure minimizes the effects from a short circuit or ground fault.
Informational  Note  No.  1:  Hard  conversion  is  considered  a change  in  dimensions  or  properties  of  an  item  into  new  sizes that might or might not be interchangeable with the sizes used in  the  original  measurement.  Soft  conversion  is  considered  a direct  mathematical  conversion  and  involves  a  change  in  the description  of  an  existing  measurement  but  not  in  the  actual dimension.
Informational  Note  No.  2:  SI  conversions  are  based  on  IEEE/ ASTM SI 10-1997, Standard for the Use of the International System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System .
