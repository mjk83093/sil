## ARTICLE 400 Flexible Cords and Flexible Cables
## Part I. General
### 400.1  Scope. This article covers general requirements, applications,  and  construction  specifications  for  flexible  cords  and flexible cables.
Informational  Note:  UL  817, Cord  Sets  and  Power-Supply  Cords , allows  the  use  of  flexible  cords  manufactured  in  accordance with UL 62, Flexible Cords and Cables .  See 400.10 and 400.12 for flexible cords that are part of a listed cord set or power-supply cord.
### 400.2  Other Articles. Flexible cords and flexible cables shall comply with this  article  and  with  the  applicable  provisions  of other articles of this Code .
### 400.3  Suitability. Flexible cords and flexible cables and their associated  fittings  shall  be  suitable  for  the  conditions  of  use and location.
### 400.4  Types. Flexible cords and flexible cables shall conform to the description in Table 400.4. The use of flexible cords and flexible  cables  other  than  those  in  Table  400.4  shall  require permission by the authority having jurisdiction.
## 400.5  Ampacities for Flexible Cords and Flexible Cables.
In  a  3-wire  circuit  consisting  of  two  phase  conductors  and the  neutral  conductor  of  a  4-wire,  3-phase,  wye-connected system,  a  common  conductor  carries  approximately  the  same current as the line-to-neutral currents of the other conductors and shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.
On a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye circuit where more than 50  percent  of  the  load  consists  of  nonlinear  loads,  there  are harmonic  currents  present  in  the  neutral  conductor  and  the neutral conductor shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.
An equipment grounding conductor shall not be considered a current-carrying conductor.
Where  a  single  conductor  is  used  for  both  equipment grounding and to carry unbalanced current from other conductors, as provided for in 250.140 for electric ranges and electric clothes dryers, it shall not be considered as a currentcarrying conductor.
#### (B)  Ultimate Insulation Temperature. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way with respect to the kind of circuit, the wiring method used, or the number of conductors such that the limiting temperature of the conductors is exceeded.
#### (C)  Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor  ampacities  shall  be  permitted  to  be  calculated  in accordance with 310.15(C).
## 400.6  Markings.
#### (B)  Optional Markings. Flexible  cords  and  cable  types  listed in Table 400.4 shall be permitted to be surface marked to indicate special characteristics of the cable materials. These markings  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  markings  for  limited smoke, sunlight resistance, and so forth.
#### (A)  Ampacity Tables. Table 400.5(A)(1) provides the allowable ampacities, and Table 400.5(A)(2) provides the ampacities for flexible cords and flexible cables with not more than three current-carrying  conductors.  These  tables  shall  be  used  in conjunction  with  applicable  end-use  product  standards  to ensure selection of the proper size and type. Where cords and cables  are  used  in  ambient  temperatures  other  than  30°C (86°F), the temperature correction factors from Table 310.15(B)(2)(a) that correspond to the temperature rating of the  cord  or  cable  shall  be  applied  to  the  ampacity  in  Table 400.5(A)(1)  and  Table  400.5(A)(2).  Cords  and  cables  rated 105°C  shall  use  correction  factors  in  the  90°C  column  of Table 310.15(B)(2)(a) for temperature correction. Where the number  of  current-carrying  conductors  exceeds  three,  the allowable ampacity or the ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced  from  the  three-conductor  rating  as  shown  in  Table 400.5(A)(3). (A)  Standard  Markings. Flexible  cords  and  flexible  cables shall be marked by means of a printed tag attached to the coil reel or carton. The tag shall contain the information required in 310.120(A). Types S, SC, SCE, SCT, SE, SEO, SEOO, SJ, SJE, SJEO,  SJEOO,  SJO,  SJT,  SJTO,  SJTOO,  SO,  SOO,  ST,  STO, STOO, SEW, SEOW, SEOOW, SJEW, SJEOW, SJEOOW, SJOW, SJTW,  SJTOW,  SJTOOW,  SOW,  SOOW,  STW,  STOW,  and STOOW  flexible  cords  and  G,  G-GC,  PPE,  and  W  flexible cables shall be durably marked on the surface at intervals not exceeding 610 mm (24 in.) with the type designation, size, and number of conductors. Required markings on tags, cords, and cables shall also include the maximum operating temperature of the flexible cord or flexible cable.
Informational Note: See Informative Annex B, Table B.310.15(B)(2)(11), for adjustment factors for more than three  current-carrying  conductors  in  a  raceway  or  cable  with load diversity.
A neutral conductor that carries only  the  unbalanced current from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be required to meet  the requirements  of a current-carrying conductor.

All types listed in Table 400.4 shall have individual conductors twisted together, except for Types HPN, SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3, SPT-1, SPT-2, SPT-3, SPT-1W, SPT-2W, TPT, NISP-1, NISP-2, NISPT-1, NISPT-2, NISPE-1, NISPE-2, and three-conductor parallel versions of SRD, SRDE, and SRDT.
The individual conductors of all cords, except those of heat-resistant cords, shall have a thermoset or thermoplastic insulation, except that the equipment grounding conductor, where used, shall be in accordance with 400.23(B).
2 Elevator traveling cables for operating control and signal circuits shall contain nonmetallic fillers as necessary to maintain concentricity. Cables shall
1 Rubber-filled or varnished cambric tapes shall be permitted as a substitute for the inner braids.
have steel supporting members as required for suspension by 620.41. In locations subject to excessive moisture or corrosive vapors or gases, supporting members of other materials shall be permitted. Where steel supporting members are used, they shall run straight through the center of the cable assembly and shall not be cabled with the copper strands of any conductor.
In addition to conductors used for control and signaling circuits, Types E, EO, ETP, and ETT elevator cables shall be permitted to incorporate in the construction one or more 20 AWG telephone conductor pairs, one or more coaxial cables, or one or more optical fibers. The 20 AWG conductor pairs shall be permitted to be covered with suitable shielding for telephone, audio, or higher frequency communications circuits; the coaxial cables shall consist of a center conductor, insulation, and a shield for use in video or other radio frequency communications circuits. The optical fiber shall be suitably covered with flame-retardant thermoplastic. The insulation of the conductors shall be rubber or thermoplastic of a thickness not less than specified for the other conductors of the particular type of cable. Metallic shields shall have their own protective covering. Where used, these components shall be permitted to be incorporated in any layer of the cable assembly but shall not run straight through the center.
4 Elevator cables in sizes 20 AWG through 14 AWG are rated 300 volts, and sizes 10 AWG through 2 AWG are rated 600 volts. 12 AWG is rated 300 volts with a 0.76 mm (30 mil) insulation thickness and 600 volts with a 1.14 mm (45 mil) insulation thickness.
3 Insulations and outer coverings that meet the requirements as flame retardant, limited smoke, and are so listed, shall be permitted to be marked for limited smoke after the Code type designation.
5 Conductor size for Types EV, EVJ, EVE, EVJE, EVT, and EVJT cables apply to nonpower-limited circuits only. Conductors of power-limited (data, signal, or communications) circuits may extend beyond the stated AWG size range. All conductors shall be insulated for the same cable voltage rating. 6 Insulation thickness for Types EV, EVJ, EVEJE, EVT, and EVJT cables of nylon construction is indicated in parentheses.
8 The third conductor in Type HPN shall be used as an equipment grounding conductor only. The insulation of the equipment grounding conductor for Types SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3, SPT-1, SPT-2, SPT-3, NISPT-1, NISPT-2, NISPE-1, and NISPE-2 shall be permitted to be thermoset polymer.
7 Types G, G-GC, S, SC, SCE, SCT, SE, SEO, SEOO, SEW, SEOW, SEOOW, SO, SOO, SOW, SOOW, ST, STO, STOO, STW, STOW, STOOW, PPE, and W shall be permitted for use on theater stages, in garages, and elsewhere where flexible cords are permitted by this Code .
9 Cords that comply with the requirements for outdoor cords and are so listed shall be permitted to be designated as weather and water resistant with the suffix 'W' after the Code type designation. Cords with the 'W' suffix are suitable for use in wet locations and are sunlight resistant.
11 Types TPT and TST shall be permitted in lengths not exceeding 2.5 m (8 ft) where attached directly, or by means of a special type of plug, to a portable appliance rated at 50 watts or less and of such nature that extreme flexibility of the cord is essential.
10 The required outer covering on some single-conductor cables may be integral with the insulation.

Exception No. 3: For a listed motor-operated appliance that is marked with  both  motor  horsepower  and  full-load  current,  the  motor  full-load current marked on the nameplate of the appliance shall be used instead of  the  horsepower  rating  on  the  appliance  nameplate  to  determine  the ampacity  or  rating  of  the  disconnecting  means,  the  branch-circuit conductors, the controller,  the  branch-circuit  short-circuit  and  groundfault protection, and any separate overload protection.
(2)  Nameplate  Values. Separate  motor  overload  protection shall be based on the motor nameplate current rating.
#### (B)  Torque  Motors. For  torque  motors,  the  rated  current shall be locked-rotor current, and this nameplate current shall be  used  to  determine  the  ampacity  of  the  branch-circuit conductors covered in 430.22 and 430.24, the ampere rating of the motor overload protection, and the ampere rating of motor
- (C)  Alternating-Current Adjustable Voltage Motors. For motors used in alternating-current, adjustable voltage, variable torque  drive  systems,  the  ampacity  of  conductors,  or  ampere ratings  of  switches,  branch-circuit  short-circuit  and  groundfault protection, and so forth, shall be based on the maximum operating current marked on the motor or control nameplate, or both. If the maximum operating current does not appear on the nameplate, the ampacity determination shall be based on 150 percent of the values given in Table 430.249  and Table 430.250.
- (D)  Valve  Actuator  Motor  Assemblies. For valve  actuator motor assemblies (VAMs), the rated current shall be the nameplate full-load current, and this current shall be used to determine  the  maximum  rating  or  setting  of  the  motor  branchcircuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device and the ampacity of the conductors.

## Part VII. Motor Controllers
### 430.81  General. Part VII is  intended  to  require  suitable controllers for all motors.
#### (A)  Stationary Motor of 1 ∕ 8 Horsepower or Less. For a stationary  motor  rated  at 1 ∕ 8 hp  or  less  that  is  normally  left  running and is constructed so that it cannot be damaged by overload or failure to start, such as clock motors and the like, the branchcircuit disconnecting means shall be permitted to serve as the controller.
(2)  Circuit  Breaker. A branch-circuit inverse time  circuit breaker rated in amperes shall be permitted as a controller for all motors. Where this circuit breaker is also used for overload protection,  it  shall  conform  to  the  appropriate  provisions  of this article governing overload protection.
(3)  Molded  Case  Switch. A  molded  case  switch  rated  in amperes shall be permitted as a controller for all motors.
#### (B)  Small Motors. Devices as specified in 430.81(A) and (B) shall be permitted as a controller.
#### (C)  Stationary Motors of 2 Horsepower or Less. For stationary  motors  rated  at  2  hp  or  less  and  300  volts  or  less,  the controller shall be permitted to be either of the following:
- (1) A  general-use  switch  having  an  ampere  rating  not  less than twice the full-load current rating of the motor
- (2) On ac circuits, a general-use snap switch suitable only for use  on  ac  (not  general-use  ac-dc  snap  switches)  where the  motor  full-load  current  rating  is  not  more  than 80 percent of the ampere rating of the switch
#### (D)  Torque  Motors. For  torque  motors,  the  controller  shall have  a  continuous-duty,  full-load  current  rating  not  less  than the  nameplate  current  rating  of  the  motor.  For  a  motor controller rated in horsepower but not marked with the foregoing current rating, the equivalent current rating shall be determined  from  the  horsepower  rating  by  using  Table  430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250.
#### (B)  Portable Motor of 1 ∕ 3 Horsepower or Less. For a portable motor rated at 1 ∕ 3 hp or less, the controller shall be permitted to be an attachment plug and receptacle or cord connector. 430.82  Controller Design. (A)  Starting and Stopping. Each controller shall be capable of starting and stopping the motor it controls and shall be capable of interrupting the locked-rotor current of the motor. (E)  Voltage Rating. A controller with a straight voltage rating, for  example,  240  volts  or  480  volts,  shall  be  permitted  to  be applied in a circuit in which the nominal voltage between any two conductors does not exceed the controller's voltage rating. A controller with a slash rating, for example, 120/240 volts or 480Y/277  volts,  shall  only  be  applied  in  a  solidly  grounded circuit  in  which  the  nominal  voltage  to  ground  from  any conductor does not exceed the lower of the two values of the controller's  voltage  rating  and  the  nominal  voltage  between any  two  conductors  does  not  exceed  the  higher  value  of  the controller's voltage rating.
### 430.84  Need Not Open All Conductors. The controller shall not be required to open all conductors to the motor.
Exception: Where the controller serves also as a disconnecting means, it shall  open  all  ungrounded  conductors  to  the  motor  as  provided  in 430.111.
### 430.85  In Grounded Conductors. One pole of the controller shall  be  permitted  to  be  placed  in  a  permanently  grounded conductor, provided the controller is designed so that the pole in the grounded conductor cannot be opened without simultaneously opening all conductors of the circuit.
### 430.87  Number  of  Motors  Served  by  Each  Controller. Each motor shall be provided with an individual controller.
Exception No. 1: For motors rated 1000 volts or less, a single controller rated  at  not  less  than  the  equivalent  horsepower,  as  determined  in accordance with 430.110(C)(1), of all the motors in the group shall be permitted to serve the group under any of the following conditions:
(b)     Where a group of motors is under the protection of one overcurrent device as permitted in 430.53(A)
(a)     Where  a  number  of  motors  drive  several  parts  of  a  single machine  or  piece  of  apparatus,  such  as  metal  and  woodworking machines, cranes, hoists, and similar apparatus
#### (B)  Autotransformer. An autotransformer starter shall provide an 'off' position, a running position, and at least one starting position. It shall be designed so that it cannot rest in the  starting  position  or  in  any  position  that  will  render  the overload device in the circuit inoperative.
#### (C)  Rheostats. Rheostats  shall  be  in  compliance  with  the following:
- (1) Motor-starting  rheostats  shall  be  designed  so  that  the contact  arm  cannot  be  left  on  intermediate  segments. The point or plate on which the arm rests when in the starting position shall have no electrical connection with the resistor.
- (2) Motor-starting  rheostats  for  dc  motors  operated  from  a constant voltage supply shall be equipped with automatic devices that will interrupt the supply before the speed of the motor has fallen to less than one-third its normal rate.
### 430.83  Ratings. The controller shall have a rating as specified in 430.83(A), unless otherwise permitted in 430.83(B) or (C), or as specified in (D), under the conditions specified.
## (A)  General.
(1)  Horsepower Ratings. Controllers, other than inverse time circuit  breakers  and  molded  case  switches,  shall  have  horsepower  ratings  at  the  application  voltage  not  lower  than  the horsepower rating of the motor.
(c)     Where  a  group  of  motors  is  located  in  a  single  room  within sight from the controller location
Exception No. 2: A branch-circuit disconnecting means serving as the controller as allowed in 430.81(A) shall be permitted to serve more than one motor.
### 430.88  Adjustable-Speed Motors. Adjustable-speed motors that are controlled by means of field regulation shall be equipped  and  connected  so  that  they  cannot  be  started  under  a weakened field.
Exception: Starting under a weakened field shall be permitted where the motor is designed for such starting.
### 430.89  Speed  Limitation. Machines  of  the  following  types shall  be  provided  with  speed-limiting  devices  or  other  speedlimiting means:
- (1) Separately excited dc motors
- (3) Motor-generators  and  converters  that  can  be  driven  at excessive  speed  from  the  dc  end,  as  by  a  reversal  of current or decrease in load
- (2) Series motors
Exception: Separate speed-limiting devices or means  shall  not be required under either of the following conditions:

Informational  Note:  The  relationship  between  motor  current and motor temperature changes when the motor is operated by an adjustable-speed drive. In certain applications, overheating of motors  can  occur  when  operated  at  reduced  speed,  even  at current  levels  less  than  a  motor's  rated  full-load  current.  The overheating can be the result of reduced motor cooling when its shaft-mounted fan is operating less than rated nameplate RPM. As  part  of  the  analysis  to  determine  whether  overheating  will occur, it is necessary to consider the continuous torque capability  curves  for  the  motor  given  the  application  requirements. This  will  assist  in  determining  whether  the  motor  overload protection will be able, on its own, to provide protection against overheating.  These  overheating  protection  requirements  are only  intended  to  apply  to  applications  where  an  adjustablespeed drive, as defined in Article 100, is used. Informational Note: The type of protective device, its rating, and its setting are often marked on or provided with the power conversion equipment. (4) Where an instantaneous trip circuit breaker or semiconductor fuses are permitted in accordance with the drive manufacturer's instructions for use as the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device for listed power  conversion  equipment,  they  shall  be  provided  as an integral part of a single listed assembly incorporating both the protective  device  and  power  conversion  equipment.
- (B)  Bypass  Circuit/Device. Branch-circuit  short-circuit  and ground-fault  protection  shall  also  be  provided  for  a  bypass circuit/device(s).  Where  a  single  branch-circuit  short-circuit and  ground-fault  protective  device  is  provided  for  circuits containing  both  power  conversion  equipment  and  a  bypass circuit, the branch-circuit protective device type and its rating or setting shall be in accordance with those determined for the power  conversion  equipment  and  for  the  bypass  circuit/ device(s) equipment.
For motors that utilize external forced air or liquid cooling systems, overtemperature can occur if the cooling system is not operating. Although this issue is not unique to adjustable speed applications,  externally  cooled  motors  are  most  often  encountered  with  such  applications.  In  these  instances,  overtemperature protection using direct temperature sensing is recommended [i.e., 430.126(A)(1), (A)(3), or (A)(4)], or additional  means  should  be  provided  to  ensure  that  the  cooling system  is  operating  (flow  or  pressure  sensing,  interlocking  of adjustable-speed drive system and cooling system, etc.).
### 430.131  Several  Motors  or  Loads  on  One  Branch  Circuit Including  Power  Conversion  Equipment. For installations meeting  all  the  requirements  of  430.53  that  include  one  or more  power  converters,  the  branch-circuit  short-circuit  and ground-fault  protective  fuses  or  inverse  time  circuit  breakers shall be of a type and rating or setting permitted for use with the  power  conversion  equipment  using  the  full-load  current rating of the connected motor load in accordance with 430.53. For  the  purposes  of  430.53  and  430.131,  power  conversion equipment shall be considered to be a motor controller.

They  shall  be  arranged  so that they cannot be serviced while they are energized.
(a)     A circuit breaker of suitable type and rating arranged so that it can be serviced without hazard. The circuit breaker shall  simultaneously  disconnect  all  ungrounded  conductors. The  circuit  breaker  shall  be  permitted  to  sense  the  fault current by means of integral or external sensing elements.
(2)  Reclosing. Fault-current  interrupting  devices  shall  not automatically reclose the circuit.
Exception: Automatic reclosing of a circuit shall be permitted where the circuit is exposed to transient faults and where such automatic reclosing does not create a hazard to persons.
(3)  Combination  Protection. Overload  protection  and  faultcurrent  protection  shall  be  permitted  to  be  provided  by  the same device.
### 430.226  Rating  of  Motor  Control  Apparatus. The  ultimate trip  current  of  overcurrent  (overload)  relays  or  other  motorprotective  devices  used  shall  not  exceed  115  percent  of  the controller's continuous current rating. Where  the  motor branch-circuit disconnecting means is separate from the controller, the disconnecting means current rating shall not be less  than  the  ultimate  trip  setting  of  the  overcurrent  relays  in the circuit.
### 430.227  Disconnecting  Means. The  controller  disconnecting means shall be lockable in accordance with 110.25.
## Part XII. Protection of Live Parts - All Voltages

## 440.12  Rating and Interrupting Capacity.
#### (A)  Hermetic  Refrigerant  Motor-Compressor. A  disconnecting  means  serving  a  hermetic  refrigerant  motor-compressor shall  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  nameplate  rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current, whichever is greater,  and  locked-rotor  current,  respectively,  of  the  motorcompressor as follows.
(1)  Ampere  Rating. The  ampere  rating  shall  be  at  least 115  percent  of  the  nameplate  rated-load  current  or  branchcircuit selection current, whichever is greater.
Exception: A listed  unfused  motor  circuit  switch,  without  fuseholders, having  a  horsepower  rating  not  less  than  the  equivalent  horsepower determined in accordance with 440.12(A)(2) shall be permitted to have an ampere rating less than 115 percent of the specified current.
(2)  Equivalent  Horsepower. To  determine  the  equivalent horsepower  in  complying  with  the  requirements  of  430.109, the  horsepower  rating  shall  be  selected  from  Table  430.248, Table  430.249,  or  Table  430.250  corresponding  to  the  ratedload  current  or  branch-circuit  selection  current,  whichever  is greater, and also the horsepower rating from Table 430.251(A) or Table 430.251(B) corresponding to the locked-rotor current.  In  case  the  nameplate  rated-load  current  or  branchcircuit selection current and locked-rotor current do not correspond to the currents shown in Table 430.248, Table 430.249, Table  430.250,  Table  430.251(A),  or  Table  430.251(B),  the horsepower rating corresponding to the next higher value shall be selected. In case different horsepower ratings are obtained when applying these tables, a horsepower rating at least equal to the larger of the values obtained shall be selected.
#### (B)  Combination Loads. Where the combined load of two or more hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors or one or more hermetic  refrigerant  motor-compressor  with  other  motors  or loads  may  be  simultaneous  on  a  single  disconnecting  means, the rating for the disconnecting means shall be determined in accordance with 440.12(B)(1) and (B)(2).
(1)  Horsepower Rating. The horsepower rating of the disconnecting  means  shall  be  determined  from  the  sum  of  all currents, including resistance loads, at the rated-load condition and  also  at  the  locked-rotor  condition.  The  combined  ratedload current and the combined locked-rotor current so obtained shall be considered as a single motor for the purpose of this requirement as required by (1)(a) and (1)(b).
(b)     The  locked-rotor  current  equivalent  to  the  horsepower rating of each motor, other than a hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor, shall be selected from Table 430.251(A) or Table  430.251(B),  and,  for  fan  and  blower  motors  of  the shaded-pole or permanent split-capacitor type marked with the locked-rotor  current,  the  marked  value  shall  be  used.  The locked-rotor currents shall be added to the motor-compressor locked-rotor current(s) and to the rating in amperes of other loads  to  obtain  an  equivalent  locked-rotor  current  for  the combined load. Where two or more motors or other loads such as resistance heaters, or both, cannot be started simultaneously, appropriate combinations of locked-rotor and rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current, whichever is greater, shall be an acceptable means of determining the equivalent locked-rotor current for the simultaneous combined load.
Exception: Where part of the concurrent load is a resistance load and the disconnecting means is a switch rated in horsepower and amperes, the switch used shall be permitted to have a horsepower rating not less than the combined load to the motor-compressor(s) and other motor(s) at the locked-rotor condition, if the ampere rating of the switch is not less than this locked-rotor load plus the resistance load.
(2)  Full-Load  Current  Equivalent. The ampere rating of the disconnecting means shall be at least 115 percent of the sum of all  currents at the rated-load condition determined in accordance with 440.12(B)(1).
Exception: A listed  unfused  motor  circuit  switch,  without  fuseholders, having  a  horsepower  rating  not  less  than  the  equivalent  horsepower determined  by  440.12(B)(1)  shall  be  permitted  to  have  an  ampere rating less than 115 percent of the sum of all currents.
#### (C)  Small  Motor-Compressors. For  small  motor-compressors not having the locked-rotor current marked on the nameplate, or  for  small  motors  not  covered  by  Table  430.247,  Table 430.248,  Table  430.249,  or  Table  430.250,  the  locked-rotor current shall be assumed to be six times the rated-load current.
#### (D)  Disconnecting Means. Every disconnecting means in the refrigerant  motor-compressor  circuit  between  the  point  of attachment to the feeder and the point of connection to the refrigerant  motor-compressor  shall  comply  with  the  requirements of 440.12.
#### (E)  Disconnecting Means Rated in Excess of 100 Horsepower. Where  the  rated-load  or  locked-rotor  current  as  determined above would indicate a disconnecting means rated in excess of 100 hp, the provisions of 430.109(E) shall apply.
### 440.13  Cord-Connected Equipment. For cord-connected equipment such as room air conditioners, household refrigerators and freezers, drinking water coolers, and beverage dispensers, a separable connector or an attachment plug  and receptacle  shall  be  permitted  to  serve  as  the  disconnecting means.
Informational Note: For room air conditioners, see 440.63.
(a)     The  full-load  current  equivalent  to  the  horsepower rating of each motor, other than a hermetic refrigerant motorcompressor, and fan or blower motors as covered in 440.6(B) shall be selected from Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table  430.250.  These  full-load  currents  shall  be  added  to  the motor-compressor rated-load current(s) or branch-circuit selection  current(s),  whichever  is  greater,  and  to  the  rating  in amperes  of  other  loads  to obtain an  equivalent full-load current for the combined load. 440.14  Location. Disconnecting means shall be located within sight from, and readily accessible from the air-conditioning or refrigerating  equipment.  The  disconnecting  means  shall  be permitted to be installed on or within the air-conditioning or refrigerating equipment. The disconnecting means shall not be located on panels that are designed to allow access to the air-conditioning or refrigeration equipment or to obscure the equipment nameplate(s).
Exception  No.  1:  Where  the  disconnecting  means  provided  in  accordance with 430.102(A) is lockable in accordance with 110.25 and the refrigerating or air-conditioning equipment is essential to an industrial process in a facility with written safety procedures, and where the conditions  of  maintenance  and  supervision  ensure  that  only  qualified persons service the equipment, a disconnecting means within sight from the equipment shall not be required.
Exception No. 2: Where an attachment plug and receptacle serve as the disconnecting means in accordance with 440.13, their location shall be accessible but shall not be required to be readily accessible.
Informational Note No. 1: See Parts VII and IX of Article 430 for additional requirements.
Informational Note No. 2: See 110.26.
## Part III. Branch-Circuit Short-Circuit and Ground-Fault Protection
