Informational  Note:  Some  elevator  motor  currents,  or  those motor currents of similar function, exceed the motor nameplate value.  Heating  of  the  motor  and  conductors  is  dependent  on the  root-mean  square  (rms)  current  value  and  the  length  of operation  time.  Because  this  motor  application  is  inherently intermittent duty, conductors are sized for duty cycle service as shown in Table 430.22(E).
- (B)  Conductors Supplying a Single Motor Controller. Conductors supplying a single motor controller shall have an ampacity not less than the motor controller nameplate current rating, plus all other connected loads.

- (1) The rated  primary  current is  the  rated  kilovolt-amperes (kVA)  multiplied  by  1000  and  divided  by  the  rated primary voltage, using values given on the nameplate.
- (3) The duty cycle is  the percentage of the time during which the welder is loaded. For instance, a spot welder supplied by a 60-Hz system (216,000 cycles per hour) and making 400  15-cycle  welds  per  hour  would  have  a  duty  cycle  of 2.8  percent  (400  multiplied  by  15,  divided  by  216,000, multiplied by 100). A seam welder operating 2 cycles 'on' and 2 cycles 'off' would have a duty cycle of 50 percent.
