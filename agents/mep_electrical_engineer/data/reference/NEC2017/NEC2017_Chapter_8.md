Note: An 'N' in the table indicates that the communications raceway type shall not be permitted to be installed in the application. A 'Y*' indicates that the communications raceway type shall be permitted to be installed in the application, subject to the limitations described in 800.110 and 800.113.
- (B)  Type CMR. Type CMR communications riser cables shall be listed as being suitable for use in a vertical run in a shaft or from  floor  to  floor  and  shall  also  be  listed  as  having  fireresistant  characteristics  capable  of  preventing  the  carrying  of fire from floor to floor.
Informational Note: One method of defining fire-resistant characteristics capable of preventing the carrying of fire from floor to  floor  is  that  the  cables  pass  the  requirements  of  ANSI/ UL 1666-2011, Standard Test for Flame Propagation Height of Electrical and Optical-Fiber Cable Installed Vertically in Shafts.
- (C)  Type CMG. Type CMG general-purpose communications cables  shall  be  listed  as  being  suitable  for  general-purpose communications use, with the exception of risers and plenums, and shall also be listed as being resistant to the spread of fire.
Informational  Note:  One  method  of  defining resistant  to  the spread of fire is for the damage (char length) not to exceed 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in.) when performing the CSA 'Vertical Flame Test Cables  in  Cable  Trays,'  as  described  in  CSA  C22.2  No.  0.3-09, Test Methods for Electrical Wires and Cables .

(2)  Other  Applications. Coaxial  cable  shall  be  separated  at least  50  mm  (2  in.)  from  conductors  of  any  electric  light, power, Class 1, non-power-limited fire alarm, or medium-power network-powered broadband communications circuits.
Exception No. 1: Separation shall not be required where either (1) all of the  conductors  of  electric  light,  power,  Class  1,  non-power-limited  fire alarm,  and  medium-power  network-powered  broadband  communications  circuits  are  in  a  raceway,  or  in  metal-sheathed,  metal-clad, nonmetallic-sheathed,  Type  AC  or  Type  UF  cables,  or  (2)  all  of  the coaxial cables are encased in a raceway.
Exception  No.  2:  Separation  shall  not  be  required  where  the  coaxial cables  are  permanently  separated  from  the  conductors  of  electric  light, power,  Class  1,  non-power-limited  fire  alarm,  and  medium-power network-powered  broadband  communications  circuits  by  a  continuous and  firmly  fixed  nonconductor,  such  as  porcelain  tubes  or  flexible tubing, in addition to the insulation on the wire.
#### (B)  Support  of  Coaxial  Cables. Raceways  shall  be  used  for their  intended  purpose.  Coaxial  cables  shall  not  be  strapped, taped, or attached by any means to the exterior of any conduit or raceway as a means of support.
Exception: Overhead (aerial) spans of coaxial cables shall be permitted to  be  attached  to  the  exterior  of  a  raceway-type  mast  intended  for  the attachment and support of such cables.
### 820.154  Applications of Listed CATV Cables. Permitted and nonpermitted  applications  of  listed  coaxial  cables  shall  be  as indicated in Table 820.154(a). The permitted applications shall be  subject  to  the  installation  requirements  of  820.110  and 820.113. The substitutions for coaxial cables in Table 820.154(b)  and  illustrated  in  Figure  820.154  shall  be  permitted.
Informational  Note:  The  substitute  cables  in  Table  820.154(b) and Figure 820.154 are only coaxial-type cables.
## Part VI. Listing Requirements
### 820.179  Coaxial Cables. Cables shall be listed in accordance with 820.179(A) through (D) and marked in accordance with Table 820.179. The cable voltage rating shall not be marked on the cable. Coaxial cables shall have a temperature rating of not less  than  60°C  (140°F).  The  temperature  rating  shall  be marked on the jacket of coaxial cables that have a temperature rating exceeding 60°C (140°F).
Informational Note: Voltage markings on cables could be misinterpreted to suggest that the cables may be suitable for Class 1, electric light, and power applications.
Exception:  Voltage  markings  shall  be  permitted  where  the  cable  has multiple listings and voltage marking is required for one or more of the listings.
