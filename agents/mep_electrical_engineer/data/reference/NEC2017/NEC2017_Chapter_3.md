## 300.20  Induced Currents in Ferrous Metal Enclosures  or Ferrous Metal Raceways.
#### (A)  Conductors Grouped Together. Where conductors carrying alternating current are installed in ferrous metal enclosures or ferrous metal raceways, they shall be arranged so as to avoid heating the surrounding ferrous metal by induction. To accomplish this, all phase conductors and, where used, the grounded conductor  and  all  equipment  grounding  conductors  shall  be grouped together.
Exception No. 1: Equipment grounding conductors for certain existing installations shall be permitted to be installed separate from their associated circuit conductors where run in accordance with the provisions of 250.130(C).
Exception No. 2: A single conductor shall be permitted to be installed in a ferromagnetic enclosure and used for skin-effect heating in accordance with the provisions of 426.42 and 427.47.
#### (B)  Individual  Conductors. Where a single  conductor  carrying  alternating  current  passes  through  metal  with  magnetic properties, the inductive effect shall be minimized by (1)  cutting  slots  in  the  metal  between  the  individual  holes through which the individual conductors pass or (2) passing all the conductors in the circuit through an insulating wall sufficiently large for all of the conductors of the circuit.
Exception: In the case of circuits supplying vacuum or electric-discharge lighting systems or signs or X-ray apparatus, the currents carried by the conductors are so small that the inductive heating effect can be ignored where these conductors are placed in metal enclosures or pass through metal.
Informational Note: Because aluminum is not a magnetic metal, there  will  be  no  heating  due  to  hysteresis;  however,  induced currents will be present. They will not be of sufficient magnitude to require grouping of conductors or special treatment in passing conductors through aluminum wall sections.
#### (B)  Fire-Rated Cables and Conductors. Support methods and spacing  intervals  for  fire-rated  cables  and  conductors  shall comply with any restrictions provided in the listing of the electrical circuit protective system used and in no case shall exceed the values in Table 300.19(A).

3. In industrial establishments, where conditions of maintenance and supervision ensure that qualified persons will service the installation, the minimum cover requirements, for other than rigid metal conduit and intermediate metal conduit, shall be permitted to be reduced 150 mm (6 in.) for each 50 mm (2 in.) of concrete or equivalent placed entirely within the trench over the underground installation.
Specific Footnotes:
b Underground direct-buried cables that are not encased or protected by concrete and are buried 750 mm (30 in.) or more below grade shall have their location identified by a warning ribbon that is placed in the trench at least 300 mm (12 in.) above the cables.
a Cover is defined as the shortest distance in millimeters (inches) measured between a point on the top surface of any direct-buried conductor, cable, conduit, or other raceway and the top surface of finished grade, concrete, or similar cover.
c Listed by a qualified testing agency as suitable for direct burial without encasement. All other nonmetallic systems shall require 50 mm (2 in.) of concrete or equivalent above conduit in addition to the table depth.
d The slab shall extend a minimum of 150 mm (6 in.) beyond the underground installation, and a warning ribbon or other effective means suitable for the conditions shall be placed above the underground installation.
connections or splices in an underground installation shall be approved for wet locations.

Raceways installed on  poles  shall  be  of  rigid  metal  conduit,  intermediate  metal conduit,  RTRC-XW,  Schedule  80  PVC  conduit,  or  equivalent, extending from the minimum  cover depth specified in Table  300.50  to  a  point  2.5  m  (8  ft)  above  finished  grade. Conductors  entering  a  building  shall  be  protected  by  an approved enclosure or raceway from the minimum cover depth to the point of entrance. Where direct-buried conductors, raceways, or cables are subject to movement by settlement or frost, they  shall  be  installed  to  prevent  damage  to  the  enclosed conductors  or  to  the  equipment  connected  to  the  raceways. Metallic enclosures shall be grounded.
#### (D)  Splices. Direct  burial  cables  shall  be  permitted  to  be spliced or tapped without the use of splice boxes, provided they are  installed  using  materials  suitable  for  the  application.  The taps and splices shall be watertight and protected  from mechanical damage. Where cables are shielded, the shielding shall be continuous across the splice or tap.
Exception: At splices of an engineered cabling system, metallic shields of direct-buried  single-conductor  cables  with  maintained  spacing  between phases  shall  be  permitted  to  be  interrupted  and  overlapped.  Where shields  are  interrupted  and  overlapped,  each  shield  section  shall  be grounded at one point.
#### (E)  Backfill. Backfill containing large rocks, paving materials, cinders, large or sharply angular substances, or corrosive materials shall not be placed in an excavation where materials can damage or contribute to the corrosion of raceways, cables, or other substructures or where it may prevent adequate compaction of fill.
Protection  in  the  form  of  granular  or  selected  material  or suitable sleeves shall be provided to prevent physical damage to the raceway or cable.
#### (F)  Raceway  Seal. Where  a  raceway  enters  from  an  underground system, the end within the building shall be sealed with an identified compound so as to prevent the entrance of moisture  or  gases,  or  it  shall  be  so  arranged  to  prevent  moisture from contacting live parts.

Informational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do  not  take  voltage  drop  into  consideration.  See  210.19(A), Informational  Note  No.  4,  for  branch  circuits  and  215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.
Informational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 13.5.1 in NFPA 79-2015, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery .
(2)  Selection  of  Ampacity. Where  more  than  one  ampacity applies for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used.
Exception:  Where different ampacities apply to portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used if the total portion(s) of the  circuit  with  lower  ampacity  does  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  3.0  m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the total circuit.
Informational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.
(3)  Temperature  Limitation  of  Conductors. No  conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds  that  designated  for  the  type  of  insulated  conductor involved. In no case shall conductors be associated together in such a way, with respect to type of circuit, the wiring method employed,  or  the  number  of  conductors,  that  the  limiting temperature of any conductor is exceeded.
(3) Be the same size in circular mil area. (4) Have the same insulation type. (5) Be terminated in the same manner. (3)  Separate  Cables  or  Raceways. Where  run  in  separate cables or raceways, the cables or raceways with conductors shall have the same number of conductors and shall have the same electrical  characteristics.  Conductors  of  one  phase,  polarity, neutral, grounded circuit conductor, or equipment grounding conductor shall not be required to have the same physical characteristics  as  those  of  another  phase,  polarity,  neutral,  grounded circuit conductor, or equipment grounding conductor. Informational Note No. 1: The temperature rating of a conductor  [see  Table  310.104(A)  and  Table  310.104(C)]  is  the  maximum  temperature,  at  any  location  along  its  length,  that  the conductor can withstand over a prolonged time period without serious degradation. The allowable ampacity tables, the ampacity  tables  of  Article  310  and  the  ampacity tables of Informative Annex B, the ambient temperature correction factors in 310.15(B)(2), and the notes to the tables provide guidance for coordinating conductor sizes, types, allowable ampacities, ampacities,  ambient  temperatures,  and  number  of  associated conductors.  The  principal  determinants  of  operating  temperature are as follows:
- (2) Consist of the same conductor material.
(4)  Ampacity  Adjustment. Conductors  installed  in  parallel shall comply with the provisions of 310.15(B)(3)(a).
(5)  Equipment Grounding Conductors. Where parallel equipment  grounding  conductors  are  used,  they  shall  be  sized  in accordance  with  250.122.  Sectioned  equipment  grounding conductors smaller than 1/0 AWG shall be permitted in multiconductor  cables,  if  the  combined  circular  mil  area  of  the sectioned  equipment  grounding  conductors  in  each  cable complies with 250.122.
(6)  Bonding  Jumpers. Where  parallel  equipment  bonding jumpers or supply-side bonding jumpers are installed in raceways,  they  shall  be  sized  and  installed  in  accordance  with 250.102.
- (2) Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents.
- (1) Ambient  temperature  -  ambient  temperature  may  vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time.
- (3) The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or surrounds conductors affects the rate of heat dissipation.
- (4) Adjacent load-carrying conductors - adjacent conductors have  the  dual  effect  of  raising  the  ambient  temperature and impeding heat dissipation.
Informational Note No. 2: Refer to 110.14(C) for the temperature limitation of terminations.
#### (B)  Tables. Ampacities  for  conductors  rated  0  to  2000  volts shall be as specified in the Allowable Ampacity Table 310.15(B) (16) through Table 310.15(B)(19), and Ampacity Table 310.15(B)(20) and Table 310.15(B)(21) as modified by 310.15(B)(1) through (B)(7).
The temperature correction and adjustment factors shall be permitted  to  be  applied  to  the  ampacity  for  the  temperature
rating of the conductor, if the corrected and adjusted ampacity does not exceed the ampacity for the temperature rating of the termination in accordance with the provisions of 110.14(C).
Informational Note: Table 310.15(B)(16) through Table 310.15(B)(19)  are  application  tables  for  use  in  determining conductor sizes on loads calculated in accordance with Article 220.  Allowable  ampacities  result  from  consideration  of  one  or more of the following:
- (1) Temperature  compatibility  with  connected  equipment, especially the connection points.
- (3) Compliance with the requirements of product listings or certifications. See 110.3(B).
- (2) Coordination with circuit and system overcurrent protection.

Where  the number of current-carrying  conductors  in  a  raceway  or  cable exceeds three, or where single conductors or multiconductor cables are installed without maintaining spacing for a continuous length longer than 600 mm (24 in.) and are not installed in raceways, the allowable ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced  as  shown  in  Table  310.15(B)(3)(a).  Each  currentcarrying  conductor  of  a  paralleled  set  of  conductors  shall  be counted as a current-carrying conductor.
Where conductors of different systems, as provided in 300.3, are  installed  in  a  common  raceway  or  cable,  the  adjustment factors shown in Table 310.15(B)(3)(a) shall apply only to the number of power and lighting conductors (Articles  210,  215, 220, and 230).
Informational Note No. 1: See Annex B for adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity.
Informational Note No. 2: See 366.23 for adjustment factors for conductors and ampacity for bare copper and aluminum bars in
(3)  Adjustment  factors  shall  not  apply  to  underground conductors  entering  or  leaving  an  outdoor  trench  if  those conductors have physical protection in the form of rigid metal conduit,  intermediate  metal  conduit,  rigid  polyvinyl  chloride conduit  (PVC),  or  reinforced  thermosetting  resin  conduit (RTRC) having a length not exceeding 3.05 m (10 ft), and if the number of conductors does not exceed four.
- (4) Adjustment factors shall not apply to Type AC cable or to Type MC cable under the following conditions:
- a. The cables do not have an overall outer jacket.
- b.  Each  cable  has  not  more  than  three  current-carrying conductors.
- c. The conductors are 12 AWG copper.
- d. Not more than 20 current-carrying conductors are installed without maintaining spacing, are stacked, or are supported on 'bridle rings.'
Exception to (4): If cables meeting the requirements in 310.15(B)(3)(4)a  through  c  with  more  than  20  current-carrying conductors are installed longer than 600 mm (24 in.) without maintaining  spacing,  are  stacked,  or  are  supported  on  bridle  rings,  a 60 percent adjustment factor shall be applied.

## 310.60  Conductors Rated 2001 to 35,000 Volts.
- (A)  Ampacities  of  Conductors  Rated  2001  to  35,000  Volts. Ampacities  for  solid  dielectric-insulated  conductors  shall  be permitted  to  be  determined  by  tables  or  under  engineering supervision, as provided in 310.60(B) and (C).
- (1)  Selection  of  Ampacity. Where more than one calculated or  tabulated  ampacity  could  apply  for  a  given  circuit  length, the lowest value shall be used.
Exception: Where two different ampacities apply to adjacent portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used beyond the point of transition, a distance equal to 3.0 m (10 ft) or 10 percent of the circuit length calculated at the higher ampacity, whichever is less.
- (4) Grounded  conductors  shall  be  permitted  to  be  sized smaller than the ungrounded conductors, if the requirements of 220.61 and 230.42 for service conductors or the requirements of 215.2 and 220.61 for feeder conductors are met. Informational Note: See 110.40 for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions.
Where  correction  or  adjustment  factors  are  required  by 310.15(B)(2) or (3), they shall be permitted to be applied to the  ampacity  associated  with  the  temperature  rating  of  the conductor.
Informational  Note  No.  1:    The  service  or  feeder  ratings addressed  by  this  section  are  based  on  the  standard  ampacity ratings from 240.6(A).
Informational Note No. 2: See Example D7 in Annex D.
- (B)  Engineering Supervision. Under engineering supervision, conductor  ampacities  shall  be  permitted  to  be  calculated  by using the following general equation:

*Refer to 310.15(B)(2) for the ampacity correction factors where the ambient temperature is other than 40°C (104°F). Refer to 310.15(B)(3)(a) for more than three current-carrying conductors.
#### (C)  Tables. Ampacities for conductors rated 2001 to 35,000  volts  shall  be  as  specified  in  Table  310.60(C)(67) through Table 310.60(C)(86). Ampacities for ambient temperatures other than those specified in the ampacity tables shall be corrected in accordance with 310.60(C)(4).
Informational Note No. 1: For ampacities calculated in accordance  with  310.60(A),  reference  IEEE  835-1994, Standard  Power Cable Ampacity Tables, and the references therein for availability of all factors and constants.
Informational Note No. 2: Ampacities provided by this section do  not  take  voltage  drop  into  consideration.  See  210.19(A), Informational  Note  No.  4,  for  branch  circuits  and  215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders.
(1)  Grounded Shields. Ampacities shown in Table 310.60(C)(69), Table 310.60(C)(70), Table 310.60(C)(81), and Table 310.60(C)(82) shall apply for cables with shields grounded  at  one  point  only.  Where  shields  for  these  cables  are grounded at more than one point, ampacities shall be adjusted to take into consideration the heating due to shield currents.
Informational Note: Tables other than those listed contain the ampacity of cables with shields grounded at multiple points.
(2)  Burial Depth of Underground Circuits. Where the burial depth of direct burial or electrical duct bank circuits is modified from the values shown in a figure or table, ampacities shall be  permitted  to  be  modified  as  indicated  in  (B)(2)(a)  and (B)(2)(b).
(b)     Where  burial  depths  are  deeper  than  shown  in  a specific  underground  ampacity  table  or  figure,  an  ampacity derating  factor  of  6  percent  per  300  mm  (1  ft)  increase  in depth for all values of rho shall be permitted.
(a)     Where  burial  depths  are  increased  in  part(s)  of  an electrical  duct  run,  a  decrease  in  ampacity  of  the  conductors shall not be required, provided the total length of parts of the duct run increased in depth is less than 25 percent of the total run length.
No ampacity adjustments shall be required where the burial depth is decreased.
(3)  Electrical Ducts in Figure 310.60(C)(3). At locations where electrical ducts enter equipment enclosures from underground,  spacing  between  such  ducts,  as  shown  in  Figure 310.60(C)(3), shall be permitted to be reduced without requiring the ampacity of conductors therein to be reduced.

## ARTICLE 314 Outlet, Device, Pull, and Junction Boxes; Conduit Bodies; Fittings; and Handhole Enclosures
## Part I. Scope and General
### 314.1  Scope. This article covers the installation and use of all boxes  and  conduit  bodies  used  as  outlet,  device,  junction,  or pull boxes, depending on their use, and handhole enclosures. Cast metal, sheet metal, nonmetallic, and other boxes such as FS,  FD,  and  larger  boxes  are  not  classified  as  conduit  bodies. This article also includes installation requirements for fittings used  to  join  raceways  and  to  connect  raceways  and  cables  to boxes and conduit bodies.
### 314.2  Round  Boxes. Round  boxes  shall  not  be  used  where conduits or connectors requiring the use of locknuts or bushings are to be connected to the side of the box.
### 314.3  Nonmetallic Boxes. Nonmetallic boxes shall be permitted only with open wiring on insulators, concealed knob-andtube  wiring,  cabled  wiring  methods  with  entirely  nonmetallic sheaths, flexible cords, and nonmetallic raceways.
Exception No. 1: Where internal bonding means are provided between all  entries,  nonmetallic  boxes  shall  be  permitted  to  be  used  with  metal raceways or metal-armored cables.
Exception  No.  2:  Where  integral  bonding  means  with  a  provision  for attaching  an  equipment  bonding  jumper  inside  the  box  are  provided between all threaded entries in nonmetallic boxes listed for the purpose, nonmetallic boxes shall be permitted to be used with metal raceways or metal-armored cables.
### 314.4  Metal  Boxes. Metal  boxes  shall  be  grounded  and bonded in accordance with Parts I, IV, V, VI, VII, and X of Article 250 as applicable, except as permitted in 250.112(I).
in  314.16(B).  The  minimum  volume  for  conduit  bodies  shall be as calculated in 314.16(C).
The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  not  apply  to  terminal housings supplied with motors or generators.
Informational  Note:  For  volume  requirements  of  motor  or generator terminal housings, see 430.12.
Boxes  and  conduit  bodies  enclosing  conductors  4  AWG  or larger shall also comply with the provisions of 314.28.
#### (A)  Box Volume Calculations. The volume of a wiring enclosure (box) shall be the total volume of the assembled sections and,  where  used,  the  space  provided  by  plaster  rings,  domed covers, extension rings, and so forth, that are marked with their volume or are made from boxes the dimensions of which are listed in Table 314.16(A). Where a box is provided with one or more  securely  installed  barriers,  the  volume  shall  be  apportioned  to  each  of  the  resulting  spaces.  Each  barrier,  if  not marked with its volume, shall be considered to take up 8.2 cm 3 ( 1 ∕ 2 in 3 ) if metal, and 16.4 cm 3 (1.0 in 3 ) if nonmetallic.
(1)  Standard Boxes. The volumes of standard boxes that are not  marked  with  their  volume  shall  be  as  given  in  Table 314.16(A).
(2)  Other  Boxes. Boxes  1650  cm 3 (100  in. 3 )  or  less,  other than  those  described  in  Table  314.16(A),  and  nonmetallic boxes shall be durably and legibly marked by the manufacturer with their volume(s). Boxes described in Table 314.16(A) that have  a  volume  larger  than  is  designated  in  the  table  shall  be permitted  to  have  their  volume  marked  as  required  by  this section.
#### (B)  Box Fill Calculations. The volumes in paragraphs 314.16(B)(1)  through  (B)(5),  as  applicable,  shall  be  added together. No allowance shall be required for small fittings such as  locknuts  and  bushings.  Each  space  within  a  box  installed with a barrier shall be calculated separately.
## Part II. Installation
### 314.15  Damp  or  Wet  Locations. In  damp  or  wet  locations, boxes, conduit bodies, outlet box hoods, and fittings shall be placed or equipped so as to prevent moisture from entering or accumulating  within  the  box,  conduit  body,  or  fitting.  Boxes, conduit bodies, outlet box hoods, and fittings installed in wet locations  shall  be  listed  for  use  in  wet  locations.  Approved drainage  openings  not  smaller  than  3  mm  ( 1 ∕ 8 in.)  and  not larger than 6 mm ( 1 ∕ 4 in.) in diameter shall be permitted to be installed in the field in boxes or conduit bodies listed for use in damp or wet locations. For installation of listed drain fittings, larger  openings  are  permitted  to  be  installed  in  the  field  in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
Informational Note No. 1: For boxes in floors, see 314.27(B).
Informational Note No. 2: For protection against corrosion, see 300.6.
### 314.16  Number of Conductors in Outlet, Device, and Junction Boxes,  and  Conduit  Bodies. Boxes and conduit bodies shall be  of  an  approved  size  to  provide  free  space  for  all  enclosed conductors. In no case shall the volume of the box, as calculated in 314.16(A), be less than the fill calculation as calculated
(1)  Conductor  Fill. Each  conductor  that  originates  outside the  box  and  terminates  or  is  spliced  within  the  box  shall  be counted once, and each conductor that passes through the box without splice or termination shall be counted once. Each loop or  coil  of  unbroken  conductor  not  less  than  twice  the  minimum length  required  for  free  conductors  in  300.14  shall  be counted  twice.  The  conductor  fill  shall  be  calculated  using Table 314.16(B). A conductor, no part of which leaves the box, shall not be counted.
Exception:  An  equipment  grounding  conductor  or  conductors  or  not over four fixture wires smaller than 14 AWG, or both, shall be permitted to be omitted from the calculations where they enter a box from a domed luminaire or similar canopy and terminate within that box.
(2)  Clamp  Fill. Where  one  or  more  internal  cable  clamps, whether  factory  or  field  supplied,  are  present  in  the  box,  a single  volume  allowance  in  accordance  with  Table  314.16(B) shall  be  made  based  on  the  largest  conductor  present  in  the box. No allowance shall be required for a cable connector with its clamping mechanism outside the box.
A clamp assembly that incorporates a cable termination for the  cable  conductors  shall  be  listed  and  marked  for  use  with specific  nonmetallic  boxes.  Conductors  that  originate  within the clamp assembly shall be included in conductor fill calculations  covered  in  314.16(B)(1)  as  though  they  entered  from outside  the  box.  The  clamp  assembly  shall  not  require  a  fill

a The maximum allowable fill areas in Columns 2 and 4 shall be calculated. For example, the maximum allowable fill in mm 2 for a 150-mm wide cable tray in Column 2 shall be 4500 minus (30 multiplied by Sd) [the maximum allowable fill, in square inches, for a 6-in. wide cable tray in Column 2 shall be 7 minus (1.2 multiplied by Sd)].
b The term Sd in Columns 2 and 4 is equal to the sum of the diameters, in mm, of all cables 107.2 mm (in inches, of all 4/0 AWG) and larger multiconductor cables in the same cable tray with smaller cables.

- (C)  Exposed  to  Physical  Damage. Conductors  within  2.1  m (7  ft)  from  the  floor  shall  be  considered  exposed  to  physical damage.  Where  open  conductors  cross  ceiling  joists  and  wall studs and are exposed to physical damage, they shall be protected by one of the following methods:
- (1) Guard strips not less than 25 mm (1 in.) nominal in thickness and at least as high as the insulating supports, placed on each side of and close to the wiring.
- (3) Boxing made in accordance with 398.15(C)(1) or (C)(2) and  furnished  with  a  cover  kept  at  least  25  mm  (1  in.) away from the conductors within. Where protecting vertical conductors on side walls, the boxing shall be closed at the top and the holes through which the conductors pass shall be bushed.
- (2) A substantial running board at least 13 mm ( 1 ∕ 2 in.) thick in back of the conductors with side protections. Running boards  shall  extend  at  least  25  mm  (1  in.)  outside  the conductors,  but  not  more  than  50  mm  (2  in.),  and  the protecting sides shall be at least 50 mm (2 in.) high and at least 25 mm (1 in.), nominal, in thickness.
- (4) Rigid  metal  conduit,  intermediate  metal  conduit,  rigid nonmetallic conduit, or electrical metallic tubing. When installed in metal piping, the conductors shall be encased in continuous lengths of approved flexible tubing.
### 398.17  Through  or Parallel  to  Framing  Members. Open conductors shall  be  separated  from  contact  with  walls,  floors, wood cross members, or partitions through which they pass by tubes or bushings of noncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating material. Where the bushing is shorter than the hole, a waterproof sleeve of noninductive material shall be inserted in the hole and an insulating bushing slipped into the sleeve at each end in such a manner as to keep the conductors absolutely out of  contact  with  the  sleeve.  Each  conductor  shall  be  carried through a separate tube or sleeve.
Informational  Note:  See  310.15(A)(3)  for  temperature  limitation of conductors.
### 398.19  Clearances. Open  conductors  shall  be  separated  at least  50  mm  (2  in.)  from  metal  raceways,  piping,  or  other conducting material, and from any exposed lighting, power, or signaling  conductor,  or  shall  be  separated  therefrom  by  a continuous and firmly fixed nonconductor in addition to the insulation of the conductor. Where any insulating tube is used, it  shall be secured at the ends. Where practicable, conductors shall pass over rather than under any piping subject to leakage or accumulations of moisture. (E)  Tie Wires. Conductors 8 AWG or larger and supported on solid knobs shall be securely tied thereto by tie wires having an insulation equivalent to that of the conductor.
### 398.23  In  Accessible  Attics. Conductors  in  unfinished  attics and roof spaces shall comply with 398.23(A) or (B).
#### (A)  Accessible by Stairway or Permanent Ladder. Conductors shall be installed along the side of or through bored holes in floor joists,  studs,  or  rafters.  Where run through bored holes, conductors in the joists and in studs or rafters to a height of not less than 2.1 m (7 ft) above the floor or floor joists shall be protected  by  substantial  running  boards  extending  not  less than 25 mm (1 in.) on each side of the conductors. Running boards shall be securely fastened in place. Running boards and guard  strips  shall  not  be  required  for  conductors  installed along the sides of joists, studs, or rafters.
#### (B)  Not Accessible by Stairway or Permanent Ladder. Conductors  shall  be  installed  along  the  sides  of  or  through bored holes in floor joists, studs, or rafters.
Exception: In buildings completed before the wiring is installed, in attic and roof spaces that are not accessible by stairway or permanent ladder and have headroom at all points less than 900 mm (3 ft), the wiring shall be permitted to be installed on the edges of rafters or joists facing the attic or roof space.
## 398.30  Securing and Supporting.
#### (A)  Conductor Sizes Smaller  Than  8  AWG. Conductors smaller than 8 AWG shall be rigidly supported on noncombustible,  nonabsorbent  insulating  materials  and  shall  not  contact any other objects. Supports shall be installed as follows:
- (1) Within 150 mm (6 in.) from a tap or splice
- (3) At  intervals  not  exceeding  1.4  m  (4 1 ∕ 2 ft)  and  at  closer intervals  sufficient  to  provide  adequate  support  where likely to be disturbed
- (2) Within  300  mm  (12  in.)  of  a  dead-end  connection  to  a lampholder or receptacle
#### (B)  Conductor Sizes 8 AWG and Larger. Supports for conductors  8  AWG  or  larger  installed  across  open  spaces  shall  be permitted up to 4.5 m (15 ft) apart if noncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating spacers are used at least every 1.4 m (4 1 ∕ 2 ft) to maintain at least 65 mm (2 1 ∕ 2 in.) between conductors.
Where  not  likely to be  disturbed  in buildings of mill construction, 8 AWG and larger conductors shall be permitted to  be  run  across  open  spaces  if  supported  from  each  wood cross  member  on  approved  insulators  maintaining  150  mm (6 in.) between conductors.
#### (C)  Industrial  Establishments. In  industrial  establishments only, where conditions of maintenance and supervision ensure that  only  qualified  persons  service  the  system,  conductors  of sizes 250 kcmil and larger shall be permitted to be run across open spaces where supported at intervals up to 9.0 m (30 ft) apart.
#### (D)  Mounting of Conductor Supports. Where nails are used to  mount  knobs,  they  shall  not  be  smaller  than  tenpenny. Where  screws  are  used  to  mount  knobs,  or  where  nails  or screws are used to mount cleats, they shall be of a length sufficient to penetrate the wood to a depth equal to at least one-half the height of the knob and the full thickness of the cleat. Cushion washers shall be used with nails.
### 398.42  Devices. Surface-type snap switches shall be mounted in accordance with 404.10(A), and boxes shall not be required. Other type switches shall be installed in accordance with 404.4.
