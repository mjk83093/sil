Notes:
1. Over 12 kW through 27 kW ranges all of same rating. For ranges individually rated more than 12 kW but not more than 27 kW, the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each additional kilowatt of rating or major fraction thereof by which the rating of individual ranges exceeds 12 kW.
2. Over 8 3 ∕ 4 kW through 27 kW ranges of unequal ratings. For ranges individually rated more than 8 3 ∕ 4 kW and of different ratings, but none exceeding 27 kW, an average value of rating shall be calculated by adding together the ratings of all ranges to obtain the total connected load (using 12 kW for any range rated less than 12 kW) and dividing by the total number of ranges. Then the maximum demand in Column C shall be increased 5 percent for each kilowatt or major fraction thereof by which this average value exceeds 12 kW.
3. Over 1 3 ∕ 4 kW through 8 3 ∕ 4 kW. In lieu of the method provided in Column C, it shall be permissible to add the nameplate ratings of all household cooking appliances rated more than 1 3 ∕ 4 kW but not more than 8 3 ∕ 4 kW and multiply the sum by the demand factors specified in Column A or Column B for the given number of appliances. Where the rating of cooking appliances falls under both Column A and Column B, the demand factors for each column shall be applied to the appliances for that column, and the results added together.
4. Branch-Circuit Load. It shall be permissible to calculate the branch-circuit load for one range in accordance with Table 220.55. The branch-circuit load for one wall-mounted oven or one counter-mounted cooking unit shall be the nameplate rating of the appliance. The branch-circuit load for a counter-mounted cooking unit and not more than two wall-mounted ovens, all supplied from a single branch circuit and located in the same room, shall be calculated by adding the nameplate rating of the individual appliances and treating this total as equivalent to one range.
5. This table shall also apply to household cooking appliances rated over 1 3 ∕ 4 kW and used in instructional programs.

#### (B)  General Loads. The general calculated load shall be not less than 100 percent of the first 10 kVA plus 40 percent of the remainder of the following loads:
- (1) 33  volt-amperes/m 2 or  3  volt-amperes/ft 2 for  general lighting  and  general-use  receptacles.  The  floor  area  for each  floor  shall  be  calculated  from  the  outside  dimensions of the dwelling unit. The calculated floor area shall not  include  open  porches,  garages,  or  unused  or  unfinished spaces not adaptable for future use.
- (3) The nameplate rating of the following:
- (2) 1500 volt-amperes for each 2-wire, 20-ampere  smallappliance branch circuit and each laundry branch circuit covered in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).
- a. All appliances that are fastened in place, permanently connected, or located to be on a specific circuit
- c. Clothes dryers that are not connected to the laundry branch circuit specified in item (2)
- b. Ranges,  wall-mounted  ovens,  counter-mounted  cooking units
- d. Water heaters
- (4) The nameplate ampere or kVA rating of all permanently connected motors not included in item (3).
#### (C)  Heating  and  Air-Conditioning  Load. The  largest  of  the following six selections (load in kVA) shall be included:
- (1) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the air conditioning and cooling.
- (3) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump compressor and 65 percent of the supplemental electric heating  for  central  electric  space-heating  systems.  If  the heat  pump  compressor  is  prevented  from  operating  at the  same  time  as  the  supplementary  heat,  it  does  not need to be added to the supplementary heat for the total central space heating load.
- (5) 40  percent  of  the  nameplate  rating(s)  of  electric  space heating if four or more separately controlled units.
- (2) 100 percent of the nameplate rating(s) of the heat pump when  the  heat  pump  is  used  without  any  supplemental electric heating.
#### (C)  Prohibited  Reductions. There  shall  be  no  reduction  of the  neutral  or  grounded  conductor  capacity  applied  to  the amount in 220.61(C)(1), or portion of the amount in (C)(2), from that determined by the basic calculation:
- (1) Any portion of a 3-wire  circuit  consisting  of  2  ungrounded  conductors  and  the  neutral  conductor  of  a  4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected system
- (2) That portion consisting of nonlinear loads supplied from a 4-wire, wye-connected, 3-phase system
Informational  Note:  A  3-phase,  4-wire,  wye-connected  power system used to supply power to nonlinear loads may necessitate that  the  power  system  design  allow  for  the  possibility  of  high harmonic neutral conductor currents.

- (A)  Feeder and Branch-Circuit Conductors. Feeder and branch-circuit  conductors  shall  be  protected  at  the  point  the conductors  receive  their  supply  as  permitted  in  240.21  or  as otherwise permitted in 240.92(B), (C), (D), or (E).
#### (B)  Feeder  Taps. For  feeder  taps  specified  in  240.21(B)(2), (B)(3), and (B)(4), the tap conductors shall be permitted to be sized in accordance with Table 240.92(B).
#### (C)  Transformer Secondary Conductors of Separately Derived Systems. Conductors shall be permitted to be connected to a transformer secondary of a separately derived system, without overcurrent protection at the connection, where the conditions of 240.92(C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)(3) are met.
(1)  Short-Circuit  and  Ground-Fault  Protection. The  conductors  shall  be  protected  from  short-circuit  and  ground-fault conditions by complying with one of the following conditions:
- (1) The length of the secondary conductors does not exceed 30 m (100 ft), and the transformer primary overcurrent device  has  a  rating  or  setting  that  does  not  exceed 150 percent of the value determined by multiplying the secondary conductor ampacity by the secondary-toprimary transformer voltage ratio.
- (2) The conductors are protected by a differential relay with a trip setting equal to or less than the conductor ampacity.
Informational Note: A differential relay is connected to be sensitive  only  to  short-circuit  or  fault  currents  within  the  protected zone and is normally set much lower than the conductor ampacity. The differential relay is connected to trip protective devices that  de-energize  the  protected  conductors  if  a  short-circuit condition occurs.
- (3) The  conductors  shall  be  considered  to  be  protected  if calculations, made under engineering supervision, determine that the system overcurrent devices will protect the conductors within  recognized  time  vs.  current  limits  for all short-circuit and ground-fault conditions.
- (2)  Overload  Protection. The conductors shall  be  protected against  overload  conditions  by  complying  with  one  of  the following:

The  prescriptive  methods  contained  in  Article  250  shall  be followed to comply with the performance requirements of this section.
## (A)  Grounded Systems.
(1)  Electrical  System  Grounding. Electrical  systems  that  are grounded  shall  be  connected  to  earth  in  a  manner  that  will limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, or unintentional  contact  with  higher-voltage  lines  and  that  will  stabilize the voltage to earth during normal operation.
Informational Note No. 1: An important consideration for limiting the imposed voltage is the routing of bonding and grounding  electrode  conductors  so  that  they  are  not  any  longer  than necessary  to  complete  the  connection  without  disturbing  the permanent  parts  of  the  installation  and  so  that  unnecessary bends and loops are avoided.
Informational Note No. 2: See NFPA 780-2014, Standard for  the Installation  of  Lightning  Protection  Systems ,  for  information  on
installation of grounding and bonding for lightning protection systems.
- (2)  Grounding of Electrical Equipment. Normally noncurrent-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected to earth so as to limit the voltage to ground on these materials.
- (3)  Bonding of Electrical Equipment. Normally non-currentcarrying  conductive  materials  enclosing  electrical  conductors or  equipment,  or  forming  part  of  such  equipment,  shall  be connected  together  and  to  the  electrical  supply  source  in  a manner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path.
- (4)  Bonding  of  Electrically  Conductive  Materials  and  Other Equipment. Normally non-current-carrying electrically conductive materials that are likely to become energized shall be connected together and to the electrical supply source in a manner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path.
- (5)  Effective  Ground-Fault  Current  Path. Electrical  equipment  and  wiring  and  other  electrically  conductive  material likely to become energized shall be installed in a manner that creates a low-impedance circuit facilitating the operation of the overcurrent  device  or  ground  detector  for  high-impedance grounded  systems.  It  shall  be  capable  of  safely  carrying  the maximum ground-fault current likely to be imposed on it from any point on the wiring system where a ground fault may occur
5. to the electrical supply source. The earth shall not be considered as an effective ground-fault current path.
## (B)  Ungrounded Systems.
- (1)  Grounding  Electrical  Equipment. Non-current-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected to  earth  in  a  manner  that  will  limit  the  voltage  imposed  by lightning  or  unintentional  contact  with  higher-voltage  lines and limit the voltage to ground on these materials.
Informational Note: See NFPA 780-2014, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems , for information on installation of grounding and bonding for lightning protection systems.
- (2)  Bonding  of  Electrical  Equipment. Non-current-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected together  and  to  the  supply  system  grounded  equipment  in  a manner  that  creates  a  low-impedance  path  for  ground-fault current that is capable of carrying the maximum fault current likely to be imposed on it.
- (3)  Bonding  of  Electrically  Conductive  Materials  and  Other Equipment. Electrically conductive materials that are likely to become  energized  shall  be  connected  together  and  to  the supply system grounded equipment in a manner that creates a low-impedance path for ground-fault current that is capable of carrying the maximum fault current likely to be imposed on it.
3. Part I General Part II System grounding (4)  Path for Fault Current. Electrical equipment, wiring, and other  electrically  conductive  material  likely  to  become  energized shall be  installed  in  a  manner  that  creates  a  lowimpedance circuit from any point on the wiring system to the electrical  supply  source  to  facilitate  the  operation  of  overcurrent  devices  should  a  second  ground  fault  from  a  different phase  occur  on  the  wiring  system.  The  earth  shall  not  be considered as an effective fault-current path.
## 250.6  Objectionable Current.
- (A)  Arrangement  to Prevent Objectionable  Current. The grounding  of electrical systems, circuit conductors, surge arresters,  surge-protective  devices,  and  conductive  normally non-current-carrying metal parts of equipment shall be installed and arranged in a manner that will prevent objectionable current.
- (B)  Alterations  to  Stop  Objectionable  Current. If  the  use  of multiple grounding connections results in objectionable current  and  the  requirements  of  250.4(A)(5)  or  (B)(4)  are met, one or more of the following alterations shall be permitted:
- (1) Discontinue one or more but not all of such grounding connections.
- (3) Interrupt the continuity of the conductor or conductive path causing the objectionable current.
- (2) Change the locations of the grounding connections.
- (4) Take other suitable remedial and approved action.
