# Administrative Governance

This directory contains policies, procedures, and guidelines for managing the AE/MEP Reference Library.

## Purpose

Ensure consistent knowledge management, access control, versioning, and contribution standards across the reference library.

## Contents

- **00_Versioning_and_Naming_Conventions.md** - File naming, version numbering, and organizational standards
- **01_Knowledge_Management_SOP.md** - Standard operating procedures for adding, updating, and retiring content
- **02_Licensing_and_Copyright_Register.md** - Copyright compliance, citation requirements, and licensing terms
- **03_Access_Roles_RBAC_Policy.md** - Role-based access control for different user types
- **04_Audit_Trail_and_Provenance_Policy.md** - Change tracking and content source documentation
- **05_Contributions_Style_Guide.md** - Writing style, formatting, and quality standards

## Key Principles

1. **Immutability of Sources**: Never modify official code content; create overlays and amendments
2. **Traceability**: All content must cite authoritative sources
3. **Version Control**: Track all changes with timestamps and rationale
4. **Copyright Compliance**: Paraphrase copyrighted content; never copy verbatim
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain clear indexing and searchability

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review pending contributions
- **Monthly**: Audit for broken links and outdated references
- **Quarterly**: Update code adoption matrices
- **Annually**: Major version review and archival
