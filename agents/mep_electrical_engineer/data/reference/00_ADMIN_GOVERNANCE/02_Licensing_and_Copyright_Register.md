## Fair Use Doctrine Application

### Four-Factor Fair Use Analysis

Fair use determination requires analysis of four statutory factors:

#### Factor 1: Purpose and Character of Use

**Favors Fair Use**:
- Educational, instructional, or informational purpose
- Nonprofit use
- Transformative use (adds new meaning, insight, or understanding)
- Commentary, criticism, or analysis

**Disfavors Fair Use**:
- Commercial purpose
- Mere reproduction without transformation
- Substitute for original work

**Application in Knowledge Base**:
✅ Educational purpose (training engineers)
✅ Transformative (applying codes to specific scenarios, providing context)
✅ Commentary (explaining how to apply requirements)

#### Factor 2: Nature of Copyrighted Work

**Favors Fair Use**:
- Factual works (vs. creative works)
- Published works (vs. unpublished)
- Works necessary for public interest (e.g., safety codes)

**Disfavors Fair Use**:
- Highly creative works
- Unpublished works
- Works where author expects licensing revenue

**Application in Knowledge Base**:
✅ NEC and codes are factual/technical (not creative)
✅ Published and publicly available (for purchase)
⚠️ Standards organizations rely on sales revenue (use cautiously)

#### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality

**Favors Fair Use**:
- Small portion of work used
- Only amount necessary for purpose
- Not "heart" of the work

**Disfavors Fair Use**:
- Large portion or entire work reproduced
- Most valuable or distinctive part used
- Amount exceeds what's necessary

**Application in Knowledge Base**:
✅ Brief excerpts only (1-2 sentences max)
✅ Paraphrased summaries instead of verbatim text
✅ Reference specific sections without reproducing full text
❌ Do not reproduce entire articles, tables, or chapters

**Guideline**: Use no more than 10% of any copyrighted work, and never more than necessary to convey the concept.

#### Factor 4: Effect on Market Value

**Favors Fair Use**:
- No substitute for original
- Does not reduce demand for original
- Might increase interest in original

**Disfavors Fair Use**:
- Acts as substitute (users don't need original)
- Reduces sales or licensing opportunities
- Harms potential market

**Application in Knowledge Base**:
✅ Engineers still need official code books for comprehensive reference
✅ Knowledge base complements (not replaces) codes
✅ May increase awareness and proper use of codes
❌ Do not create comprehensive restatements that eliminate need for codes

### Fair Use Best Practices for Knowledge Base

**DO**:
- ✅ Cite specific NEC/code sections by number (e.g., "NEC 210.19(A)(1)")
- ✅ Paraphrase requirements in your own words
- ✅ Provide context, examples, and application guidance
- ✅ Use brief quotations (1-2 sentences) when necessary for clarity
- ✅ Add transformative content (interpretations, calculations, comparisons)
- ✅ Link to official sources for full text

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Copy entire code articles or sections verbatim
- ❌ Reproduce code tables without permission
- ❌ Create comprehensive code summaries that substitute for official text
- ❌ Scan and distribute copyrighted documents
- ❌ Circumvent paywalls or access controls

### Example: Fair Use Compliant Content

**❌ PROHIBITED (Verbatim Reproduction)**:
```
"210.19(A)(1) General. Branch-circuit conductors shall have an ampacity
not less than the maximum load to be served. Conductors of multioutlet
branch circuits supplying receptacles for cord-and-plug-connected portable
loads shall have an ampacity of not less than the rating of the branch circuit."
```

**✅ PERMITTED (Paraphrased with Attribution)**:
```
NEC 210.19(A)(1) requires branch-circuit conductors to have ampacity at
least equal to the maximum load they serve. For multioutlet circuits with
portable loads, conductor ampacity must meet or exceed the branch circuit
rating. For example, a 20A circuit requires conductors rated for at least 20A.

Reference: NFPA 70®, National Electrical Code®, 2023 Edition, Section 210.19(A)(1).
```

**✅ PERMITTED (Interpretive Commentary)**:
```
When sizing branch circuit conductors per NEC Article 210, engineers must
ensure the conductor ampacity meets the maximum expected load. The Code
(Section 210.19(A)(1)) establishes this as a minimum requirement to prevent
conductor overheating. In practice, this means:

1. Calculate the connected load (VA or amperes)
2. Apply demand factors if permitted (NEC 220)
3. Select conductor size with ampacity ≥ calculated load
4. Verify compliance with OCPD coordination requirements

Reference: NEC 2023, Article 210.19
